  1. On the east side of Lochlong, opposite to Ardentinny, there ie the farm of Peston. On this farm, s burn descends from a eteepish hill which feces the nourth. A gneiss boulder lice in s gorge out by the Larn through rocks of clay slate. The bouider     rests on the rocky sides of the burn, jammed in between the sides. The boulder has some local uame like *“ Jenny Meullen,” meaning “ House on a knoll.” The beight of the bonlder above the ses is about 226 feet. Its distance from the sea-beech is about three- quarters of & mile. The size of the boulder is about 24 x 18 x 12 feot. It is most probable that the boulder was transported across tho loch from the north or north-west, and was arrested in its further progress southward by the hill, on the north side of whioch it standa Two eketahes of this boulder are given on Plate II. figs. 1 and 2. 2. Between the site of this boulder and the sea-beach an old ses margin occurs at @ height of about 45 feet above the sea (medium level). A number of boulders lie along the line of this ses margin. There is sn old sea margin on the opposite or west side of the loch, at exactly the eame height—viz., 45 feat. 3. Close to the beach in this part of Lochlong —i.e., about 8 or 9 feet above high-water mark—at a place called “ Letter,” there lies another gneiss boulder, 12 x 8 x 8 feet. Its long diameter points N.W. by N.—viz, to Glenfinnart Valley. 4. Very near this boulder (about 100 yards to the north) the clay slate rocks have besn ground down and smoothed. Their emoothed surfaces show numerous strie pointing N., 2° or 8° W, (magnetic). The smooth surface dips townrds the nortb at an angle of 3° or 4°. 5. On the hill above Carrick Castle, situsted on Lochgoil, there is a boulder called *‘Clach udelain,” or the “Stone nicely balanced.” It is at & height of 1626 feet above the sea. This boulder is of goeiss, and lies on rocks of clay slate. It lies on a bare rock, the face of which slopes to N.N.E.—s.e., towards Lochgoil. The boulder i» within three or four yards of the edge of & presipitous rocky cliff, which goes vertically down about 500 or 600 feet. The block is of enormous size. Unfortunately the note taken of its dimenuions has been lost. This boulder, from its position, could not have fallen from any hill. There is no hiil near it from which it could have failen. A sketoh of this boulder is given on Plate 1L fig. 3. 6. The next boulder visited is about two miles to the eastward of the lest-meuntioned, and is within a quarter of & mile of Lochgoil, neer its junction with Lochlong. It is about 450 feet above the sea. It msy be observed, that sll the rocks in this district have their smooth f{aces towards the north, their rough faces towanls the south. This boulder has received the name of the “Giant's Put ting-Stone,” from & legend which alleges that in former times thare were giants who inhabited the distriet on both sides of Loch- long, and who were in the practice of amusing themselves by throw- ing these huge boulders scross the loch, Therock on whioh it rests slopes gently N. by E. This rock presents a large surface, ground down and smoothed. The space of rock ocoupied by the superimposed boulder is only 18 inches by 12 inches. It would not be dificult for two men with strong levers to move the boulder from its narrow resting-place, in which case the boulder would probably roll down the steep hillside into the loch. Two skotches of this boulder are given on Plate ITI. figs. 4 and 5. 7. To the north of Knep Farm-house, there is a small hill, on or very neer the top of which eight or ten boulders are clustered. They suggest the idea that this hill hes arrested or interrupted the body, whatever that body was, which transported the boulders, and caused them to be stranded here. 8. There is another hill lower down the valley of Knap (about 480 feet above the ses), the top of which consists of olay alate rocks, rounded and smoothed by some agent passing over from the vorth. It has received the popular name of the “ Pig's Back.” Several boulders lie on this ridge. The largest rest on a very small portion of rock. A sketch of this ridge of rock, with boulders on it, is given on Plate III. fig. 6. 9. Pulag boulder is near the top of a hill to the west of Glen- finoart, about 824 feet above the sea. It is a large bluck of gneiss, about 7 feet high. There ere many othor smaller boulders lying near it, The large boulder is almost on the edge of a precipice which goes down at least 200 feet. It could not have been rolled or pushed to its present position. The levels of the district show the greatest openings towards the north—a circumstance which suggests that the boulder came from the north. Moreover, its south end rosts on & smaller boulder, which seeme to have stopped its progress further south. A sketch of this boulder is given on Plate III. fig. 7. 10. Along various parts of the hills in this district where their highest ranges are seen sguinst the eky, and ot & height of about 2000 feet above the sea, bounlders are discernible from a distance, lying on the ridges. It would be very desirablo to obtain particular acoounts of boulders at s0 high an elevation. 11. In the last Report of the Committee, notico was taken of & boulder in Ayrshire called the * Hunterston Boulder.” Along the same const, sud especially on the property of Mr Alexander of Boydstone, several very lurge boulders may yet be seen. One, called the ** Boydstone Rock or Stone,” is situated about two miles north-west of Ardrossan. Some chips of the boulder, sent to the Convener in a lotter, show that it is porphyritic. The rocks on this part of the coast are Old Red Sandstone. The boulder is in length sbout 19 feet, and in breadth about the same. It is pastly buried in the mud of the shore, Its highest point is 9} feet above the shore. It is said to contain 40 cubic yards above the shore line. It is supposed that the boulder is buried to the depth of 5 feet. The tide st high water leaves about 3 feet of the boulder visible. This boulder has inapired the poetic genius of an Ayrshire letter-carrier (Maloolm Kerr, post-messenger between Ardrossan end West Kilbride), who, through Mr Weir of Kirkhall, has sent to the Convener the following stirring address :— To the Great Boulder on the shore opposite to the lands of Boydstone, two miles novth of Ardrossan, Ayrshire. ** Can'st thou apeak, old grey stone, Unto me ! List thon to the ocean’s moan, I to thee : Music sweet [ Spirits string Wild ditties, a8 they cling To the big waves which swing Aroand thee, Stranger | whenoce didst thon come To this shore 1 Art thou an Arctic orumb, ‘Which of yore On soms huoge iceberg side From thy first home did glide, A wauderer on the tide, To this ahore ! Many oyes with wonder, Ages gone, Looked on thes ! What number Yet unknown, Will gare with curious eye, Secking to kuow thy history, And solve 8 hidden mystery, Old grey stone.” Besides the boulder which inspired these verses, there are two others, also on Mr Alexander’s property—one of them, as Mr Woeir states, “ even larger than the big stone at Brigurd, at Hunter- ston.” This larger one it was proposed to eplit up for building purposes at Ardrossan; but Mr Alexander interfered, and saved it. There sre many other boulders along the Ayrshire sea-cosst, but none so large as the Boydstone boulder. A chip of one of these sant, showe that it is of gneiss, indicating a northern origin. 12. A report has been received of s gneiss boulder near Dun- blane, on the property of Cromlix, belonging to the Hon. Captain Drummond. The length of the boulder is stated to be 17} feet, ita breadth (on an aversge) 10, its height about 5 feet. Its longer axis lies in & direction sonth-west and north-east. At ite south end it dipe into the ground at an angle of 45°. Its weight above ground is estimated at 34 tons. Its beight above the ses is sbout 450 feet. It is about four miles south from the Grampians. The same reporter (Henry Wilkie, Ashfield Worke, Dunblane) refors to s group of four boulders in the parish of Redgorton, at the west end of a gravel ridge on the farm of Bertha, the property of Murray Grabam, Eeq. of Murrayehall. Three of these Redgorton boulders are within an area of 30 yards. They are angular; fiat on the top, and some of them square. They seem to be Silurian rocks. They are distant sbout twelve miles from the Grampians. 13. Notice has been received by the Convener from Mr Robert- son, C.E., who is in cherge of the Albert New Docks at Leith, that boulder clay was found in excavating for the dooks beneath the shore line, to the depth of about 70 feet. The clay was full of large blocks, Some of these were of sandstone, weighing 10 or 12 tons, and appeared to be of the same rock ss that worked at Granton and Craigleith Quarries to the westward. Beneath the boulder olay, there was found what the engineers call & “running eand " lying over strata of shale snd sandstone. Before concluding, the Committee may advert to the circumstance that a part of the districi comprehended in this Report was many years ago described by an eminent Scotch geologist—the late Charles M‘Laren—and with refercnce to the very matters embraced in this report. Mr M‘Laren read papers in this Society, in the years 184647, describing the boulders then existing.on the shores of the Gairloch, and on the hills between that loch and Lachlong. Even then the destruction of boulders in that quarter had begun, being appropristed, as. Mr M‘Laren states, to building purposes; and probably by this time they heve sll been annihilated. Mr M‘Laren in these papers described also the striation and smoothings of the rocke, which he found from the ses-shore up to the tope of the ridges, betweeu the Gairloch and Lochlong, st heights of about 1000 feet above the sea. Itis due alike to the memory of our Associate, and Lo the interests of geological science, to mention, that the boulders referred to by him, as found on the Gairloch, consisted of grey granite, of which he counted above a hundred, one-third of them exceeding 30 tons in weight; s also mioa slate, which, though less numerous, had had smong them blocks of 60 and 80 tons in weight. As the rocks of the Gairloch in sifu, are of a more recent kind—viz. clay slate—Mr M'Laren justly inferred that the boulders were of northern origin. For those of granite, he pointed to Ben Cruachan, & mountain exceeding 3000 feet in height, situated to the NNN.W., and distant about thirty miles. The mica elate hills are also in the ssme direction, somewhat more distant. From his study of the boulders and other phenomena in this district, Mr M‘Laren drew two important conclusions. One conclusion wes, that the boulders must bave been brought to the district from the parent moun- tains, scross valleys and ranges of hills, on ice floating on s sea which stood from 1500 to 2000 feet above the present sea-level, and in which a strong current had prevailed from the NN-W. This con- clusion, it will be noticed, is confirmed by the facts specified in the VUL IX. 2a present Beport, and also in former Reports by the Committee. The numerous instances given in these Reports of huge boulders ehown by their composition to be of northern rocks, clustered frequently on the summite or peaka of hills, at heights of 1500 and 2000 feet above the preseut sea-level, seem to leave no doubt regarding the soundness of that conclusion to which Mr M‘Laren had come to thirty years ago, The other conclusion to which Mr M‘Laren came, and which many good geologists of the present day hold, was thia, that local glaciers bad at one time existed in all those valleys. This be inferred from observing, that the striations on the rocks were sll, as he thougbt, exactly parallel with the axis of the valley, and which here generally runs in & direction north-west and south-east ; and also from discovering accumulations of gravel and clay in the form of elongated embaukments—some across the valleys, others parallel with the valleys, rominding him of the lateral snd terminal moraines of Switzerland. Abs to the soundness of this second conclusion, or the correctness of the observations an whioh it was founded, the Committee give no opinion, None of the members of the Committee have visited the localities, and their fanction ss a Committee hes been chiefly to collect facts conneoted with the boulders. But it may mot be out of place to record the fact, that another of our Associates, the late Bobert Chambers, who had also given much attention to this branch of geological science, went to examine the distriots referred to by Mr M‘Laren, and expreased doubts regarding these lest- mentioned views. In two papers read by him in this Society in December 1852, Ohambers states, that on the rocky ridge between Lochlong and Holy Lach, at a height of 600 feet above the sea, the direction of the striations was uot parallel with the valley, but “ glanting over the hill ;” and as the striations were not merely on the sides of the valleys, but on the tops of the hilly ranges dividing the valloys, he thought they were more probably due to e general glaciation of the country than to local glaciers. Chambers quotes also the opinion of Sir Roderick Murchison, “ thet there is no imaginable centre for the issue of glaciers of the ordinary kind down the Gairloch.” On this point the Committee offer no opinion, and wish only to advert Lo the investigations of eminent Sootoh geolo-   gints wko in former days attempted a solution of these difficult ques- tions, The Committee would venture to suggest a re-examination of the localities, a8 the fuller knowledge now possessed on these subjects may possibly throw a clearer light on the phenomena. The Committee wish only to add, that if any geologists, whether fellows of this Society or not, happen, in the conrse of their rambles through the country, to fall in with or heer of any boulders re- markable for size, position, or composition, not yet mentioned in the Committee’s Reports, the Convener will be happy to receive a notice of them. A After some conversation, in which Mr Ferguson of Kinmundy, Dr Bryce, the Rev, T. Brown, and others took part, the Report was adopted, and the proceedings terminated.
