  ARGYLLEHIRE, 1. Glenelg.—Blocks of grey and red granite occur in the drift beds through which the river Elg has cut The rocks of this dish trick are not granite but clay achists, On the right side of the valley of the Elg, immediately above the road about 2} miles cast of Glenelg, there iz o grow granite boulder 21 x 18 x 10 feet 88 shown on files 1 and 2, Plate L The sharp end points N.N.W, Its height above the road is 1020 feet above the ses 1120 feet It goos by the name of the Meacrae Boulder, in consequence of & prophecy by a Mackenzie of Kintail, that some day when one of the clan Macrae is travelling on the road below it will fall and crush him The boulder is on the very edge of & shelf of the hill and pro jets beyond it about 6 feet is shown in fight 1 and 2, Plate L The rocks on which it lies are clay-stone schisms The boulder must therefore have been drought to its present position It is said that on & hill some distance to the west there is a granite rock similar to that of the boulder By what means aud how the boulder was deposited in its present precarious position it is difficult to explain Posaibly, when deposited there was no steep cliff at the edge of which it now project The whole valley may have been illed with detritus up to the level of 1100 fest and thereafter scooped out by the river as the sea in falling from one level to another gave to the river more cutting power This process of scooping might have continued for such length of time that the cliff thereby formed af length reached the holder 8. Ju Glen Rossdgle about 8 miles from Glenelg), at a height of about 900 feel above the ses thers is a boulder of coarse red granite 5 x 4} x 3 fest on the top of a narrow ridge of hypersthene rock na shown on fig 3, Plate IL, on the left aide of valley YOL. IX. 48 Before, however describing these higher terraces it may be right to rear to certain flats at the mouths of the valleys near the sea The town and village of Glenelg arc situated on a flat which prevail all along the Scotch coasts about 11 or 12 fest above high water mark Between Glenslg and Glonbeg the base of some high rocky cliffs is at the same level BMr Fraser, schoolmaster at Glenelg, having learned that tho Convener was desirous of seeing examples of flat land conducted him to the following spots — {1.) At Glenbernera, about half a mile to the north of Glenelg, there isa well-defined flat about 44 or 45 felt above high water A corresponding flat occurs at many other parts of the coast {2.) Behind and above the new schoolhouse at Glenelg, there is a considerable extent of flat land at 2 height of 72 feet above high watari On the opposite ., the south side of the valley which is half a mile distant there iz a flat at exactly the same height judging by the spiritlevel. The river has cut through this flat Ita original formation cannot bo ascribed to river action Beyond the manse and church there is another extensive flat 88 feet above tho sea In a higher part of the valley there are terraces on e smaller analog If they slope with the river as they seem to do they pro baby had been formed by the river when it ran at a higher level that is when the sea also stood at a higher level than now Near the mouth of Glenbsg, about a mile from the scan there is a great mass of detritus through which the river Beg has cut its channel Thers is a flat here also on each side of the river the level of which is about 120 feet above high water Fig. 6, Plate L. is from memory a plan of this valley The parts marked a, a, &c., ave patches of detritus the tops of which are all on the emo level or very nearly so viz 50 feet above the sea The whole valley apparently had been filled with detritus when the sea stood at least 150 or 200 feet above its present level As the sea retired channels were cut in the detritus not only by the main stream now occupying the valley but by the numerous and rapid side streams from the steep mountains which enclose the valley on both idea At about 3 miles from the sea the place in Glen Beg is reached Ita position also is precarious and suggest a doubt whether when brought here it could have been deposited on the precise point where it now stands Thers was nothing to indicate the direction from which the boulder had come 3. There is another boulder on the right side of the valley about 820 fest above the sea 12 x 15 x 7 feet fig 4, Plate I. It lies on a shelf near the ridge of a hill and close to a slope of the hill which rides up from the boulder and facing the N.W. The spot suggested the idea that the boulder had been brought from the N.W., and that this hill stopped ite further progress There is towards the N.W. an opening among the hills through which it might have been floated towards ite present sita 4. A little lower down the valley (Rossdale), and on the same give at & height of about 630 feet above the sea there is a rocky knoll somewhat flat on the top and presenting an area of about 8 or 8 yards in diameter on which are five or six boulders lying pretty close together as shown on fig 5, Plate I. The boulder ere granite the knoll ia mica schist 6. At e still lower part of the glen there is a steep hill sloping down to the river Near the top of this hill and on the very edge overhanging the river a boulder beats at a height of 300 feet above the river The boulder is of granite about 20 fest in diameter It rests on mica late rocks which form & smooth surface sloping down towards the river at an angle of about 30°. Its paid tion indicates transport from the north as the land there is low enough to have allowed it to be floated over whilst high hills to the south exclude that direction In the valleys where these boulders lie there are some remarks able terrace 'They were made known to the Convener by Captain Burke, R.E,, two years ago when he was still at the head of the Scoteh Ordnance Survey. The surveyors employed ine drawing the contour linea for the maps were struck by the horik mortality and continuity of the terraces Captain Burke was 80 obliging a to draw on the Conveners map lines to indicate their position As these terraces suggest important views bearing on the position of the boulders and their mode of transport it seems not irrelevant to record the notes supplied by Captain Burke and give a copy of the map to show where the terraces arab where Captain Burke states he noticed a horizontal terrace on but sides of the river at a height of 330 fest above the sea it is marked {A) on plan fig 7, Plate IL The Convener recognised a terrace on the right bank at 338 fest but he could see none on the opposite or left bank At e little distance farther up there are on the left bank gravel knoll at a somewhat higher level At this place the channel of the river is about 40 feet below the terrace and is of rock which has of course prevented any deeper cutting of the drift beds At the junction between Glen Beg and Glen Roesdale (B) in the plan thers are very large knoll of detritus with flattened topaz From the highest of these knoll the Convener, on looking across the valley in & direction by compass 1. by N., descried a terrace con tenuous for about 80 yards and apparently horizontal Its position is indicated on the plan by five small vertical strokes When the spirit level was turned in a direction shout E by 8., it struck on another horizontal terrace about half a mile distant All thats flats are at one height visit 628 feet above the sea Higher no Qlen Rossdale on the left bank and at a spot about 14 mile from (B), there is an extensive flat which had been marked by Captain Burke. He state it st 760 feet shove the send The Convener made it 760 feet When a person is on the terrace it is not distinctly traceable for more than 300 or 400 yards ; but when viewed from the opposite side of the valley at a distance of about & quarter of miles it can be distinctly traced for more than a mile continuously ; and at its east end it iv seen to cross the ridge which divides Gllen Beg from Glen Rossdale, In e higher part of Glen Roasdale, and still on the left sids of the glen the Convener observed trace of a shelf at 853 feet with a steep slope or bank blow it of about 30 feet in height The Ord- nance surveyor observed traces of a horizontal terrace still higher viz at 1500 feet above the sea The Convener, looking in that direction observed at a distance of about 3 miles something like & horizontal line running for nearly i nile continuously at what might be about that height On the plan Captain Burke indicates as existing in adjoining glens traces of the 330 feet terrace by the cypher 0. 'These glens the Conveuer hal not time to visit   He has also put X at the head of three several glens to indicate that at teas places and at 8 height of 750 feet there are gravel heaps Some quotations may be made from Captain Burke's letter dated with August 1876 — T was up Glenalg yesterday There is evidence of the sea having stood at more than one height considerably above its present level “The only terrace of any consequence is in Glen Roassdale. It is about 300 yards in length [t has nothing in the Jeast resembling Glen Roy. “ I will now answer your questions :— 1.—Height above the sea (1) Principal torraco, about 750 feet (2) Another, very doubtful . . 530 (3) Some rather moro apparent . 336 ,, ¢ This terrace at the had of Clen Beg, affords strong evidence of a beach such is now exists in all sea lochs hereabouts Deds of gravel at 330 felt are cut through by the stream running through the valley “On crossing the high neck 450 feet above the sea and descending inte Glenmore, similar beds were found at the head of that valley at the same altitude * The spot marked in my sketch mir at 530 feet is very doubtful “The 750 feet terrace is visible in patches in Glenbog and Glen Rossdale, I tried to trace it down Glenmone, for I have no doubt the land between these goons was once an island But, although I fancied T found & mound sometimes it can't be traced ““The longest vestige of a terrace which I saw is in Glen Rossdale, viz about 300 yards ; for the rest there is only a mound here and there on the hill side “ Ag to the width of the terraces the greatest I saw is about 30 yards ' *“You ask how high up these hills is sand and gravel found ? I saw appearance of gravel at over 1200 feces Thero are gravel heaps at 750 feet at the heads of the valleys marked X, at the spots ona would expect to find them and also at &, apparently washed when the country was under water and since cut through by the streams in the valleys  In fact all the appearsuco is as if these valleys wore once sea lochs just as are Lochs Nevis and Hourn at the present day These marks are frequent throughout the Highlanda. I have seen similar gravel-beda along streams in several other glens “ Whether it will be decided to survey the shelf I cannot say But there is nothing definite except the bit in Glen Rossdale; and a surveyor would not find it easy when on the hillside to know what mounds he should show unless he had previously rua a contour at the required height T have made two sketches one of Glenbeg looking east another of Glen Rosedale looking west which I shall be happy to show you."” With reference to these last remarks by Captain Burke, it occur to the Committee to express an opinion that when the Ordnance surveyors discover on the hill sides terraces of the kind referred for there should be some record given of them on the maps accord panned by a contour line at the same lovel along the adjoining hills so that it might be seen whether there are separate patched of gravel elsewhere at the same height It is also desirable that when the officer at the head of the Burvey verifies what the surveyors have found and makes sketches of the terraces these sketches should be given with the maps when published In walking down Glen Rossdale valley on the right bank the Convener fall in with & large mass of detritus cot up into a series of knoll by the action of streams and rain The height of these knoll above the sca was on an average 858 feet—agrocing pretty nearly with the level of the shelf already noticed as existing on the oppo site side ofthe valley These remains of gravel in Glen Rossdale and the adjoining glens looking to tho height and the form in which they court seem conclusive as to the occupation of these valleys by the sea and they confirm the inference derived from the position of the boulders that the boulders were probably floated into these positions The Convener was at first puzzled to account for the circumstance that most of the large boulders which ho saw in these valleys were not upon drift but upon bare rock ; and in many other part of the country the same thing occurs If these boulders were floated by ice and thrown down they must most generally have fallen upon the retrial beds then forming the sea-bottom, and not upon bare rocks When the sea retired the boulders would then be on the drift or buried in it. But when the streams from the hill sides began to flow and to remove the drift the boulders would sink until rock was reached by them where of course they wonld remain The denotation of the old sea-bottoms has been everywhere so extend sive that very probably most of the boulders now existing are not in precisely thoe exact positions which they occupied when originally deposited 6, In the Pass of Brander, where the River Awe flows out of the lake of the came name there are several boulders deserving notice On the right bank of the river near the spot where there is a pier for the small Iake steamer there are two terraces om drift Both terraces have boulders on them The boulders are of reddish granite The rocks in the Pass are a slay schistose ruck like greywacke. The boulders have apparently come from some distant region as the granite of the Loch Etiive hills is not red but almost entirely grey in colour The height of Loch Awe above the sea is by Ordnance Survey) 110 feet The lowest terrace is 68 feet the higher terrace about 120 feet above tho loch Both terraces appear to be horizontal They can be traced for nearly a mile continuously On the opposite or left bank of the river no corresponding terraces are distinguishable That side of the valley consists of nearly bare rock and is almost vertical so that there cannot be expected to be on it any trace of a beach line Have these terraces in the Pass of Brander been formed by a lake or by the sea In a lower part of the valley there is a large amount of detritus and it reaches at some places to a higher level than the terraces The valley in that lower part is marrow so that there might have been a blockage for a lake On the other hands how can the granite boulders be accounted for which are on the terraces 3 If, as seems most probable they have coms from tho north they must have been floated by ice ou a current flowing from the N.N,'W, 7. Inveraray.—His Grace the Duke of Argyll (Nov. 1876) con ducted the Convener to a small hill about 1000 feet above the ses at & place called * Bras Leckan,” 7 miles weat of Inveraray, well covered with angular boulders The boulders were of the same nature e the rocks of the hill dark grey porphyry But the boulders had evidently been transported to the hill from some other place thers being no cliff from which they could have fallen The Duke thought they had been floated from the eastward and in that direction certainly the land was Jower than in any other direction But the Convener observed that towards the weat thera was an opening among the hills low enough and wide enough for a current to have flowed to and over the hill on which the boulders rested 8, A few miles to the work of freveraray there are some home boulders of a coarse conglomerate quite distinct from any of the rocks in the immediate neighbourhood The rock of these boulders is a greenish or grey coloured Silurian rock full of quartz pebbles One of these conglomerate boulders weighing about 60 jonas is on flat ground about 800 feet above the sea and resting on gravel Another, six 9} x T} feet weighing about 48 tons is on the left bank of the River Arey, and about 180 feet shove the sea The gamekeeper who pointed out these boulders sail that there waa no rock of the kind composing them except at a place about 6 miles due west Dotween that spot and the site of the boulders there were several ranges of hills and valleys ‘When the subject was mentioned to the Duke of Asgyll, he borrow bloated the gamekeeper's statement He informed the Convener, that there is conglomerate rock of the same character as that of the boulders on the summit or ridge between Loch Awe aud Loch Fine, which lie to the northwest of the boulders On the tops of several of the hills to the northwest of Inverarsy, about 700 feet above the sea boulders ware noticed where it was manifest from their peculiar position that they could have got into it only by coming from the west Sketches of these were taken 9. Oban and Neighbourhood.—(1.) At Dunolly, close to the sea shore there iz a grey granite boulder 12 x 8 x 6 feet Tt is about 20 felt above high water and rests in an old sea beach Iis longer diameter points W, by N. The nearest rocks of grey granite are in Loch Etive, situated to the eastward There are ranges of hill between Loch Etive and the site of the boulder Moreover, the boulder is close to the foot of & high rocky cliff which being on the east side of the boulder must have prevented the boulder reaching ita bite except by trans port from the westward,—probably the northwest as the island of Kerrera is situated to the west and southwest and would prep vent the boulder coming from that direction The Convener wes accompanied by a gentleman resident in the neighbourhood (Mr Clerk), woll acquainted with the Loch- Etive granite who expressed doubts whether the granite of this boulder was of a similar composition (2} The north part of Kerrern Island is strewed with numerous grey granite boulders all well rounded Most of them are on the beach and on the old terraces adjoining the beach Thers are some also on Ballimore Farm, ot heights of from 357 to 437 feet above the sea on short terraces or flats of detritus facing the east and north-cast, In these case there would be less obstruction to i transport from Loch Etive than in the case of the Dunolly boulder but the range of hills near Glenlonan, reaching heights of from 6500 to 1500 feet still presenta & difficulty If the Dunolly boulder cams from a northern source the Kerrera boulders probably came from the same quarter {3.) On the hills to- the east and northeast of Oban, thers are numerous boulders chiefly of granite whose position does not suggest one direction more than any other The rocks of these hills being clay slate tho boulders on them must have been transported from some distant quarter The granite ia grey of different variatics, and very like the Loch Etive granite But there are others with large crystals of quartz and felspar which betoken some other source One of this kind is on a hill to the south of the old public road between Oban and Loch Etive, at & height of 530 feet above the sea It is extremely angular and rests on a bare rock of the hill This position would most easily have been obtained by floating ice Besides these granite boulders there are some of dark porphyry and of quartzite which most probably come from the north This conclusion is somewhat strengthened by the circumstance that in this district where tho rocks are smoothed and striated the surface of the rocks elopes down towards and faces the north and VoL II. 4T the strip run north and south Examples occur on the old public road before-mentioned. (4.) An angular boulder of grey granite 11} x 7} x 7 feet occurs at Inverlievern, on Loch Etive, above Bonawe Ferry, Thia boulder rests on three or four smaller granite boulders and these again on bare granite rock 'There is no hill from which it could have fallen It must have been transported A sketch was taken It rests on the 40 feet old sea-margin, which i visible round the greater part of Looh Etive (6.) The Convener was informed of two very large boulders in the district between Loch Etive and Glen Lonan, st places called Auch- nacoshen and Duntarnichan. But he was unable to reach them 10. Famacloich on Loch Creran,—Captain Bedford, R.N., wrote to the Convener, calling his attention to & large boulder which he had seen when surveying for the Admiralty, He sent a description of it, and mentioned that its average girth was 30 feet The Convener discovered the boulder it had recently been blown up into four or five fragments with a view to being used for building & brings But they were found unsuited for the purpose being too hard for masons tools The rock consisted of a dark porphyry with which the Convener was unacquainted Mr Hall, the tenant of the farm of Fasnacloich, on which Captain Bedford’'s boulder was situated conducted the Convener to a spot about & mile higher up the glen where there were multitudes of much larger boulders of the same species of rock The spot proved to bea mase of detritus consisting of waterborne gravel forming a sort of terrace abutting against the hill which forma the northeast side of Glen Creran. This terrace is covered by numerous boulders some of very large size A view of one of them is given in fig 8, Plate L This boulder has the Celtic name of * Fas-na-cloich,” or © Fas- na-clach,” which means stone with growth,”.--referring to three trees growing on it, two on the top being firs each about 15 feet high),—one at the side & stunted oak The name of the farm occupied by Mr Hall, and of the residence of the proprietor Captain Stewart, is Fasnacloich, socalled most probably after the boulder The boulder with the three trees on it is about 26 yards in girth ; its length is 23 feet its width 15, and its height in so far as visible above ground is 15 feat Another boulder a few hundred yards to the south measured above ground 18 x 18 x 12 feet : 1§ deserves notice that the sharpest end of each boulder points in the samo direction—rviz., about 8. W. (magn.)—i.c., towards the mouth of Lock Creran, The terrace on which these boulders lie in about 290 feet above the sea Hsll mentioned that in i higher part of Glen Crean, the boulders are mors numerous and some of them larger than the two examined All the boulders appeared to be of the same species of rock Hell, who evidently had some practical knowledge of rocks called it & black granite and affirmed that there was no granite like it in all that district .The rocks of the mountain on the opposite or south side of Loch Creran, rising steeply to a height of above 2000 feet he knew were a grey granite The Loch Etive granite about four miles to the south and the Durra granite about eight miles to the east being of & light grey colour he had always wondered where these dark coloured boulders could have come from The rocks in Loch Creran, and in the hills immediately adjoining are & blue schistose clay elated with a rapid dip : Cne or two other points may hore be noted communicated by Hall :— ' A small river runs into Loch Creran, at its head flowing out of a small freshwater last which is separated from the sea by a spit of gravel and sand crossing the valley and cut through by the river The sand Hall stated is full of seashells and to is the bed of the lake and even the channel of the river before reaching the lake In this Inst-mentioned river the shells are in a bed of fine clay—whitish in colour which is used as & manure for arable land In fact it is this bed of shell clay which originated the name ¥ Crer-an,” ie., “ QOlay," or “ Chalk River." These facts indicate of course a period when the sea stood at ' a higher level to the extent of at least 20 feet which is about the sight of the shelly bed above mentioned When the ses fell to ite present level a blockage of drift now between the sea and the Jake, caused the lake to be formed with an overflow by the river which run out of the lake into tho scan  There are several other places in the West Highlands where there are freshwater lake close to the sea formed in like manner ‘With regard to the boulders it occurred to the Convener, judging from their locality and their position that they had probably been floated up Loch Creran, and been then stopped in their further pro great by the contraction of the valley and the higher level of the land But if they were floated up Lock Creran, from what quarter did they come - It waa natural to look Lo places facing the mouth of Loch Creran, if in these place thers were mountain composed of rocks similar in composition to the boulders The island of 3Mull, situated to the W.8. W, of Loch Creran, seemed therefore to be one locality which might have supplied the boulders as from Mr Judd's instructive paper on Mull,* describing numerous varieties of granite in the mountains of that island it appeared likely that rock of the same character as the Fasnacloich boulders existed there With the view of testing this ides the Cobpvener sent specimens of the boulders to Professor Judd, who he heard had during the past autumn spent three months among the Mull mountains and asked him to state whether he recognised the rock composing these holders as being identical with or at all events similar to, any of the Mull rocka Profeasor Judd was so obliging as to respond to the application With the Fasnacloich specimens there went to Professor Judd specimens of the rock composing two very large boulders on the shore at Appin, which rock the Convener found on examination to be the same as that of the Fasnacloich boulders These Appin boulders lie on upturned blue clay slate rocks Their shape indie hated that they had undergone great friction in consequence pro baby of being rolled over the sea-hottom by iceberg floating through what was then & sea smite but now the Linnhe Loch, and the chain of lakes forming the Caledonian Cansl. Bketches of these Appin boulders were taken The largest is 15 x 11 x 10 feet Both boulders are well rounded at the angles Professor Judd’s Report is iu the following terms :— “ Appin Boulders, No. 1.—This rock ia not a granite but a rock of basic composition It appears to be a gabby with some black mica It is very similar in character to the gabby of Bkye, Rum, Ardra- i * see " Geolog. Soclety's Trans ™ merchant and Mull, which are described in my paper I think there is no room to doubt it was derived from one of these Jocalities the rock is to peculiar and well characterised o Fasnacloich Boulders, Nea. 2, 3, 4, are very ordinary gabbros, muchas form great mountain masses in Skye, Awlnamurchan, and Mull. These rocks are of a striking character and differ from any which I know of on the mainland I think it is certain they were derived from the Western Isles.” Professor Judd, in his paper on the ancient volcanoes of Mull, Bkye, and Avdnamurchan, refers to proofs that these volcanoes reached a greater height above the sea-lovel than any of the existing Scotch mountains perhaps even to the height of 14,500 feet and that * denudation” had acted to an enormous extent in breaking up the old volcanic rocks and lowering their height Professor Judd does not particularly specify the nature of the deluding agent which he supposed produced this effect But if the sea with ice floating in it, at a height of say 2000 or 3000 fact above the present lovely be allowed to be a denning agent it iz easy to see how the boulders of Appin and Fasnacloich, if derived from Mull or Ardnamurchan, might have reached their present positions The distance of Appin and Fasnacloich from Mull and Ardna- merchant is about 30 miles The intervening sea hay in some places a depth of 100 fathoms The island of Lismore, which is in this part of the Linnhe Loch, at one spot only reaches a height of 420 fest A sos current flowing across Muil and Ardnamurchan, towards and through what is now known as “* Glen na Albin,” with mountains on each side of the Glen reaching to 2000 feet above the present zea-level, might by floating ice have carried boulders and lodged them in lateral valleys such as Loch Creran, 11, Crinan Canal—At the summit level about halfway between the two extremes there iz & large accumulation of boulders chiefly angular in shape On the weat side of the canal at the *‘Zocks,” a body of rock stands up whose surfaces facing the worth present marks of abrasion as if caused by some body or bodies passing over from the north On the south aide of this rocky knoll lie & numb ber of boulders which if they came from the north on floating ice may have been projected over the knoll by its intercepting the ice * Quarterly Journal of the Geological Bociety for August 1874, page 250, in its farther progress through this kyle or sea channel .One of the largest of the boulders is lying with ita longer axis N. and 8, or parallel with the general axis of the valley at this point These conditions would be met by the sea standing at i eight of from 140 to 150 feet above the present level On both sides of the valley here there are horizontal lines traceable ab that height as if made by the sea 12. Islend of Islay.—The Convensr, in August 1877, paid a visit to this island for the purpose chiefly of examining the famed raised sea beaches on the adjoining island of Jura, and also of inspecting some boulders of which notice had been sent to him (1.) On the farm of Laseit, about three miles south of Port Askaig, there are four or five boulders of large size QOnly two were scene One of these 13 x B x 8 felt ia & composite rock containing crystals of quartz sugite and hornblende The stone iz ex extremely hard ; it was with much difficulty that i small specimen was detached - The boulder was resting on a bed of bright yellow clay apparently a sediment of deep water The rocks of the district are & slay schist On inquiry it waa surmised that rock of a similar kind existed near Kildalton, about 30 miles to the S.E. But doubt exists on this point The other boulder scarcely so large as the foregoing resembled a compact Silurian rock containing numerous crystals of a whitish felspar There wea nothing to indicate how or from what quarter these boulders came  Their height above the sea was about 300 feet (2.) On the farm of Arnahoo, about three miles north of Port Askaig, and 228 feet above the ses a holder stands conspicuously on the summit of a hill in a position most precarious fig 8, Plate IIL). The rock composing the holder is a hard porphyry quite different from the rocks of the hill on which it rests Its height above the sea is 228 feet and the hill steel is about 300 yards from the sea towards which it slopes very steeply The boulder is not absolutely on the highest peak of the hill but & few felt below the peak and on the slope which faces worth by east (magn.). The only way in which the boulder could have stack on this slope was by its coming right against it, and being let down on it gently ¢.e,, without falling from a height it must have come in a direction from N. by E. If floating ice brought itand no other way is here concsivable—from the south the boulder could not have reached its present position It would have stuck on the south side of the hill It could not have reached ita position by & somersault over the hill top for the impetus acquired by ite fall would have projected it down the hill altogether As bearing on the direction from which this boulder may have come it is proper to add that towards the northwest there ig a range of hills apparently much higher than 300 feet whilst towards the north and northeast it is open sea and the island of Mull is in that direction {3.) On the farm of Persibua occupied by Mr Rounsfell), about three miles 8. W, of Port Askaiy, four or five boulders well rounded occur and wore seen Thoy are all of o hard porphyritic rock differing from any of the Islay rocks Their height above the sea was found to be about 228 feet ; With regard to the probable line of transport to their positioned it may be noticed that towards N. by E. there is an opening or depressed part of the country through which the boulders might have been floated to their sites . Mr Rounsfell pointed out a very large boulder situated on a hill slope to the north about two miles distant which however the Clonvener was unable to visit DBut Mr Ballingall, factor on the Ialay estate has had the kindness to examine the boulder at the request of the Convener, and he reports as follows :—*Girth, 331 feet height 11 feet ; length 12 feet breadth 18 fast It lies on clay late rocks and is all exposed to view Its thickest end faces B.'W. Its height above the sea is 410 faet.” Mr Ballingall bas sent with his letter a small chip of the boulder It proves to be an igneous rock with much hornblende It has probably come from some northern region The weight of the boulder Mr Ballingal estimates at 25 tons {4.) On the south side of the high rond between Bridgend and Port Helen i boulder rests at the foot of & low hill which faces ghost due north The boulder is tolerably well rounded and about 7 feet in diameter It is a stranger to this district Mosi probably it came from the north like the rest and was in ita farther progress intercepted by the hill at the base of which it lies Ita height above the sea is about 50 feel (See fig 10, Plate I11.) (5.) On the west coast of Islay, in the parish of Kilcheran, there are porphyritic boulders lying on the blue slate rocks and so situated as to make it clear that they have been brought and lodged there by some agency from the N.W. Below the old parish church of Kilcheran a small stream joins the ses through a valley in a direction W.N.W. (magn.). The rocks on the month bank of the stream are ground down and striated in such i way i to show that some force has passed obliquely across the valley from N.W. In regard to these Ialay boulders it is very apparent that they have all come from the north—some of them very probably from Mull. It is also rather remarkable that the largest should occupy sites very nearly on the same level viz 228 feet above the ses a circumstance suggesting the same means of transport As bearing on this last point it may be observed that on various parts of the Bcotch coats there are traces of old sea-beaches, st heights between 250 and 500 feet above the present sea-level. 13. On the Peninsula situated between the Fisih of Clyde on the cast side and Lock Striven on the west side there are several boulders of some interest (1.) At Dunoon and Kirn there are boulders of a micaceons sandstone rock all wall rounded lying on the edges of the blue slate rocks which form the beach One has had painted on it the words ** Jim Crow,” being 15 x 8 x 6 feet another the words * John Bull,” 16 x 12 x 6 feet It was stated to the Convener by i local correspondent that rock of the same nature os in these boulders occurs in the Holy Loch, situated about a mile to the northwest Two of the boulders on this part of the beach are so fixed as to indicate from what quarter they must have coms into their present position viz from the North. Sketches of these were taken (2.) Along the shore towards Innellan there are numerous boulders differing from the rock on which they lie Some of these rocks show surfaces smoothed and striated the strip running northeast and south-weal—a direction parallel with the general line of cost Some local agency has therefore probably been at work here . {3.) On the east short of Loch Striven lies the large well-rounded boulder called  Craty na C'alleach,” or *“ Stone of the Witch"—the legend being that in former times the witches inhabiting both B o | banks of the loch threw these great stone at ome another It ia said that on the west bank of the loch near Strome Point, and almost immediately opposite to “Craig na Calleach,” there is a louder of about the same size—which, however the Convener was unable $o go in search of * Craig na Calleach” is a compact schist of a light grey colour with thick nodules of quartz in it. The rocks of the beach on which the boulder lies are a slay schist of a greenish blue color A sketch was taken (+) On the farm of Ach-nafoud, situated about a mile from *Craig na Calleach,” there is on the slope of & hill an angular boulder It is at a height of 222 feet above the sea and on the edge or verge of i precipitous bank It meets partly on rock and iz in & very critical position If the bank be now in the same condition ag when the boulder was deposited it must have been let down very gently or gradually to avoid receiving an impetus which would have caused it to roll down the bank A sketch was taken PBERWICKSHIGE, In the parish of Dunse the boulder clay has lately been cut through for some hundred yards to meke a new road and to a depth of 8 or 10 fest below the surface of the boulder clay Beds of gravel and and Ho over the boulder clay in come places to the thickness of 12 fest On an inspection by the Convener (November 1877), in come pany with Mr Stevenson, Dunse, boulders in the clay were recog wised a having all come from the west chiefly W. by N. The Kylez Hill and Dirrington Hills porphyria were among these ; the former is three miles W. by N., the latter six miles W.N.W. There were also sandstone with fossils which Mr Stevenson knew to have come from a sandstone rock & few hundred yards to the westward and which he pointed out to the Convener. The fossils were the ordinary plants of the coal formation and an annelise DUMEBARTONSHIRE. 1. Zoch Lomond.—The large Dlica schist holder reported to the Committee by Mr Jack, and mentioned in the Committee’s Second Report (Roy. Soc, Proc. for 1872-73, pa 152), was visited by the Convener, in corapaoy with Mr Smollett of Cameron House. Its ¥oL. IX, iv provincial name is  Hersfone Galloch,” it is situated on the farm of Callendoon, and is about 150 feet above the sea Its length ia 28 felt ; width 19 feet depth 12 feet It is shown on fig 11, Plabe ITL,, with Mr M'Arthar, tenant of the farm standing on it. Originally, the boulder had been in a somewhat higher position A small stream running past the boulder at ite east side had washed away part of the gravel bed on which it had been resting,—-so allow ing it to sink With reference to the quarter from which this boulder was trans ported Mr Jack suggested that if it came from the weet it must have come over hills from 1000 to 1200 feet high and therefore he thought it more probable that it had been floated south down the valley now tempted by Loch Lomond, and then floated west up Glen Fruin. It appeared to the Convener, that the line of transport wes more likely from the westward The land towards W. by N. {trus), is on ahout the same level a the land to the northeast as shown by the contour lines on the Ordnanve maps of the district If the boulder came from the westward there would be no obstruction to ite progress in a direct line whereas if it came ftom the north end of Loch Lomond valley as suggested by Mr Jack, it must have changed ita course to reach Callendoon, 2. On & moors about half a mile to the north east of the above boulder there are several smaller boulders of mice schist of the shape and size show on fig 12, Plate IIL It will be observed that they all occupy similar positions in report of their longer axis and their sharpest end Their height above the ca is about 260 feet The rocks of this district are Old Red Sand- stone There is much probability thet these boulders had been left hete by floating ice in a current sewing from the westward and " that they required their bearings from the action of the ewmrent. 3. Om the west side of Loch Lomond there is at Arden a low valley which runs up from the Loch in a westerly direction The summit level of thia valley towards the west is about 150 fest above the wear Along the south side of this valley a number of boulders chiefly of primitive rocks have been deposited They are at i height of about 94 feet above the scan As banal the moved frequent position is here 03 elsewhere N.W. and 8.E. for the longer axis and the sharpest end towards the west 4. In the policy of Cameron House a boulder of gneiss 6} xu x & feet ia Iying on gravel and at a height of about 85 feet above the lake or 80 felt above the sea [Its longer axis is N.W. and 8.E 5. There is a hill called * Caer-man,” about 3 miles to the 8.W. of the south end of Loch Lomond. Its height above the sea is 720 feat From its top a good view is obtained of Helensburgh and Greencck towards the 8. W, The rocks on the top of this hill are a coarse porphyry Huge fragments have been strewed in great abundance down the side of the hill eloping eastward and especially 8. E.  The unmoved rocks present their weet surfaces rounded and smooth their east surfaces angular and rough On examining the separate block where heaped upon one another it waa apparent that the uppermost blocks to obtain their positions must have been projected on the others from the westward EAST LOTHIAN. Linton,—On the farm of Drylaw, a greenstone boulder 54 x 83 % 3 felt was found in cutting a deep trench through the boulder clay The N.W. end was the most rounded The longer diameter was N.N.W. (magn). There were no strip on the top but there were horizontal stress on the two sides fronting the N.E and the S.W, These two gives met in an angle towards the N'W. If a current had flowed from W, by N, the current would divide aft the angle end if ice floated in the current the strip on the twa wide might have been produced by hard pebbles from the westward pushed against them The smoothing and striation on the north were greater than on the south side Close to the boulder there were pebble of limestone shale sandstone and coal which most probably came from the west ward Thenearest greenstone rocks are on tha Garlten hills situated about € miles ta W. by N. The boulder therefore most probably came from these hills About half & mils to south there are rocks (vix, in Linton vile lager and in & railway cutting fo the west presenting smoothing and striations made by some agent moving ever them from W. by N.

No boulders or smoothing are on east side 2. I'n Bogward Den (Mr White Melville’s property 3 miles west of Bt Andrews, thers is a boulder of conglomerate rock Probably it came from Drum Carro Craig, which is said to be same species of rock and situated some miles to N.W. The legend is that the devil threw it from that hill when the first Protestant church was being erected at St Andrews. 3. At Kincrasg, Fife, there is on the beach i granite boulder with girth of 23 feet and height of 4 feet The lower half is angular the upper half rounded Has this boulder been floated from westward and heen stranded on the rocks at Kincmig Stirling Caatle, which is visible bears W. § N.

The Convener having been informed by the officers of the Ord- nance Suryey that some remarkable horizontal terraces had been discovered by them in Glendoe, a valley branching off from Glen Morriston, on the north side of the Caledonian Canal, he took the opportunity when paying i visit to Mr Ellice of Invergarry, of going to Glendoe, Under the guidance of two gamekeepers on the property of Mr Grant of Invermorrison, who reside at the foot of Glendoe, the Convener proceeded to the head of Glendoe, the place indicated in his map by the Ordnance Surveyors. Unfortunately, a heavy fall of show had (17th October 1877) occurred during the night preceding this visit and it continued during tha expedition A There waa at first some difficulty in making the gamekeepers come pretend the spot wished to be reached and it was not till the party had gone some miles up the valley of the Doo, that the gamekeepers began to see what was sought for at the head of the glen This was brought about by the Convener drawing attend tion as he proceeded up the valley to two lines of & terrace or flat noticed by him on & hill on the opposite side of the river On bis asking the keepers whether there were similar lines at the head of the glen,—still about 6 miles distant as they alleged ifhe answer was that thers were such terraces and so remarkable that on one occasion when accompanying a shooting party some of the gentle ~ men remarked that marks ware there of Noah's flood ! The Convener was encouraged by this information and in spite of snow und wind continued his progress up the glen . The keepers stated that the marks to which they referred were on “ English Hill;” and that though this hill waz rocky on some parts there was a great deal of sand and gravel near the top Following up the river Doe, & point was reached whers the river divided into two branches and called by a Celtic word meaning “Tongue of the Burus.” The portion of the stream towards the right hag the name of ' Carriscreuch,” or * Middle Corry ;" and it wea along that stream flowing through what the keepers called *“The Long Glen,” that * English Hill” could hest be reached But the show was here so deep that no track was visible and walking be came dangerous at least to a stranger At this point a consultation was held The height above the sea reached was only about 850 feet whereas tho highest terrace marked by the Ordnance Surveyors was 1280 feet and apparently still about 2 miles further up the glen The gamekeepers advice was to abandon eny hope of reaching the terrace and to be satisfied with u distant view of the place which could be obtained from & low hill in front This low hill accordingly was ascended end with satisfactory red suits  The hill itself was found to consists sa shown by numerous sears of fine gravel and send ; and on ita flat top the android showed a height above the sea of 1190 feet This gravel knoll was as it were in an amphitheatre of hills on several of which towards the weat horizontal terraces were observed al i somewhat lower lovely These appeared to run continuously for about a miles On the opposite side the hill bearing about oast showed a short line a$ the same level Looking towards  English Hill” an the N.E, no terraces were discernible ; the mow ewing o the direction of the wind which wae west waa 80 thick on the alone of the hill facing the knoll that Inequalities, if any existed were undiseaverabls, But one of the keepers pointed in the direction of the part of the hill for the terraces is had before spoken of The part 80 pointed out seemed to be about 2 miles distance and at an elevation of about 100 feet above the knoll en which the party were then standing The Ordnanos Surveyors had marked on the Conveper's map two lines of terrace one at 1280 and the other at 1140, e existing on a hill on the left side of the Doe water Though, from the circum dances above stated it was impossible to make ous these terraces there was enough discovered to show a line at the lowest of there levels on the other hill adjoining—and the existence of detritus quite capable of being formed into a terrace at a much higher level One of the keepers stated that on & hill towards the N.W, there were beds of gravel and sand to the very top and without any covering of turf He pointed in the direction of Ben Doe, which has an elevation of 2000 fost above the ssa The Convener having on hia wey up Glen Doe observed several large boulders on the elope of & hill above him op the left hands resolved to visit them on his way bask Bo, accompanied by cue of the keepers he ascended the hill and in looking across the valley he discovered four horizontal terraces on the opposite hill and con tenuous for about half 4 miles They were apparently on detritus for at one spot where a rock projected there was an interruption The uppermost terrace the android showed to be about 8% felt above the sea the lowest about 895, The first of the boulders visited was 919 feet above the sea Iis dimensions roughly measured were 14§ » 11§ x 7 feel It was & coarse reddish granite and very angular It could not have been rolled or pushed It seemed to bave been carried from ita parent rock whoever that was without undergoing any change of form It was resting on gravel and sand The next boulder reached waa at a height of 1204 feet above the sea Ttalso wasa coarse red granite It was about 30 yards in girth and 14 or 15 feet in height It iz know as * The Glen Morrizon Stone,” probably because of being the largest boulder in the glen This boulder is on & fat and in looking across the valley & terrace is seen which corresponds in level with the boulder In several part of the hill the boulders were in clusters or groups piled over one another T4 deserves notice that all these boulders were meeting on gravel and sand ; and that the hills on both sides of the valley war thickly covered with detritus The gamskespore spoke of a very large boulder at Clachnaharry, aboat 16 feet high on the south side of Loch Clunfe, which is two or three miles to the west of Glen Doe. The Convener saw it " through his glass It may be added here that Mr Ellice of Invergarry informed the Convener of a large bed of pure white sand which he could not distinguish from sea sand existing on a property belonging to him in that district 5% a height of about 1000 felt above the ses MID-EOTHIAN. 1. In September 1877 the Convener visited excavations on the north side of Craiglockhart Hill, about two miles 8, W, of Edinburgh. His attention was drawn to them by Mr Huichison of Carlowrie, These excavations were in the boulder clay A number of boulders had beem exposed and were still undisturbed in their original positions The largest waa angular the smaller boulders were comparatively round The greatest number were of blue whinstone rock Among the smaller boulders there were some of sandstone The contractor for a large new building about to be erected being present had his attention drawn to the sandstone boulders and was asked if he know any rock of the same kind which was in sufficient quantity to be quarried He said that the sandstone of Hailes Quarry and Red- hall Quarry was the some rock a that of the boulders Cn being asked to point out the direction of these quarries from where the boulder lay he pointed in i direction which was N.W. by come pass).* * These quarries are about i mile distant from the ate of the bonkers The height of these boulders above the sea is about 340 fest 3. At Granton Herbour on weet aide a very large blue whine stone boulder lies on the beach at high-water mark part of which only is visible the reet being covered end concealed by the sea wall which protects the red On the upper surface of this boundary there are innumerable strike the direction of which is W. 3° 8. (magn). Abont 100 yards to the eastward there is another whinstone boulder having an iron ring in it, by which boats or vessels may be moored There are trim on it running in the same direction Betwesn these two boulders there are some strata of hard sand stone rock portions of which have beon ground down and show striations running also as above 3. In the Now Docks, situated lo the eastward of Leith, there is an immense bed of boulder clay which continues along the coast eastward for eome miles This boulder clay at the Docks is covered by a muddy sand in horizontal beds about 8 or 10 feet thick On the surface of the boulder clay there is & bed of oyster shells of large size There is as usual on the surface of the boulder clay a great accumulation of boulders these having remained when the upper portion of the boulder away hed waa washed away by the ses Most of the boulders are well rounded The largest I saw a light coloured blue whinstone measured 10 x 8 x 8 feet and was estimated to weigh 18 tons About nine-tenths of the boulders are whinstone but there are also some of quartz limestone aandstons, silurian grants and black ironstone concretion from beds of shale These boulders have evidently come from the westward On a great many there are ruts or strike all maintaining the same direction viz W. by N. (magn.) Those which are longer than they are broad have their longer axis in the same direction Among the boulders there were two metallic in composition which deserve special notice One, nearly spherical measures 7} inches in circumference and * The Committee have to thank Mr Hugh Campball, who is professionally engaged in the formation of these new docks for bringing to them the two remarkable halls here referred to, as well na for affording to the Convener opportunities for seeing the excavations weighs 24 oz It was found about 4} feet down in the boulder clay among the large boulders The other ball was even more spherical its least girth being 30 inches and its greatest 31 inches Its weight was 54 Ibe, It was found 10 feet below the top of the boulder clay Professer Crum Brown (Edinburgh University) waa o obliging a to examine both of these balla for specific gravity and composed tion He report that the smallest ball is marcasite or white iron pyrates and that its specific gravity is 4'63. It is entirely of pure ore being apparently unmixed with any other substance With regard to the larger ball the Professor has sent the follow ing report :— “The fragment of the large round stone which I took for examine nation had & specific gravity of 3:36. It consisted of a mixture of silica not obviously crystalline and iron pyrates in the following PR e B 1 H iwo B « Pyrites, 477 him o * Caloulating from these numbers and the spy grab it is plain that the pyrates must be in the ¢ marcasite ’ form as * pyrite ' would give a considerably higher ape gra *“ The spy gra of the whole stone ¢.e., the mean epi grab was found to be 3'28. It cannot therefore be a uniform mixturs,” Mr Murray having kindly offered to examine microscopically thia Iarge stone ball has sent the following report :— “ Challenger Office, Teviot Row, May 1878. “Dear Sir,—The microscopic section of the boulder is made up of crystalline particles of quartz and marcasite The marcasite fills the intestines between the grain of quartz and among the quartz there are pieces of mica (Signed)  Jomw Murmav.” The Convener paid two visita to the excavations in the boulder clay st Teith to examine the spot where these two remarkable balls were found He saw the superintendent who was directing the excavations and also the ““navyy ” who found the larger ball The latter pointed to a whinstone boulder and said the big bullet waa close to this holder YOI IX, ix -~ There can be no doubt that both balls had come with the boulders and had been deposited with them in the great bed of clay which covers the rocks in this district This bed extends for fully half a mile on each side of the Water of Laeith at its mouth and reaches to a depth in some places of nearly 100 fest The black ironstone concretion found in this boulder clay bed show marks of friction There are strata of shale containing such concretion two or three miles to the westward These coneretions, as well as the boulders of granite and quartz clearly indicate transport on a large scale from the westward The Convener learns from Mr Robertson, C.E., Albany Street, Fdinburgh who planned both the Albert Docks at Leith, exec cute some years ago and the new docks now being constructed that similar metallic balls were found in the Albert Docks excavate lions DBut he has no specimens of them * Since the foregoing was written tha Convener has received from Mr Cherles W. Peach, of 30 Haddington Place, Edinborgh, i letter regarding marcasite nodules from which letter with Mr Peach's permission the following extracts are made 1 — “1In the Falkirk and Slamannan district a band of these nodules known as * Speckied Ball Tronstones,” occurs It occupies a horizon a few fathoms above that of the * STaly Band fronsgone,’ the hase of the Coal measures “The direction of the swim on the rocks and the carry of the boulders and boulder clay is towards the cast and series from E. 10° N. to E. 156° N. “ Near Kilsyth, and about 2 miles to the west of that place the tributaries of the Corre burn cross an area of blue shales with several courses of ironstone nodules Some of these are of iron pyrates (marcasite), and are known among the mining population as grassy balls They occupy a horizon between the Hosie and Hurlet limestones near the base of the carboniferous limestone series ““Tha direction of the strike and carry of the boulders in this district i E. orE B°N. . “ Fither of these sources could simply daily at Leith, as they are right in the direction of the ice-flow. “ As to eoncretiorary balls in sandstone others is on the coast of East Lothisn near Cockburnspath, to the north of Cove, a clif of cruciferous sandstone full of spherical coneretions, which weather out on the wasting of the chief by the send and being harder than the matrix they lie piled up in great numbers at the base of the cliff Many of them are of very large size “ Similar concretionary balls occur in sandstone rocks ot Grauge Quarry near Baratislond, from whence no don't the ball found lately ot Leith waa carried (Signed) “C.

At Alnwick Hill, near Liberton Church, ot an elevation of about 350 felt above the ses extensive excavations have been made in the boulder clay for the new Edinbnrgh waterworks The boulders consist chiefly of fragments of rocks which are known to be in situ situated in districts of the country to the west and northwest The great majority of the boulders are of hard red sandstone rock such a occurs at Grange and Merchiston, to the west of edinburgh though these place aro at a lower level Thare are boulders of marine limestone similar to rocks of that description in Linlith- gowshire. There is an immense quantity of bluecoloured green stones and dark-coloured basalts and also buffcoloured telepathic rooked There ara some small boulders of pure quartz which pro baby hail from the Silorian rocks to the northwest of Callendar and Doune, ; Many of the boulders occupy positions present shapes and bear works of some interact The largest seen by the Convener were about 7 fest long by 4 feet wide and 24 thick or deep The boulders were all well rounded and smooth but more part ticularly to on what had been the upper and the under sides Mr Black, the superintendant of the excavations being aware of the interest attaching to the position of the boulders and the serie on them had with a compass ascertained that the long-shaped boulders before being moved generally were lying in directions barging between W.N.W. and N.W. ; that the strike when such existed were almost always parallel with the longer axis of the boulder ; and that there were etriz, sometimes only on the upper give sometimes only on the lower idea sometimes on both sides In one of the boulders well rutted on the under side he had red marked that the mta were deepest at the east end of the boulder and that they gradually diminished in depth and numbers towards the west This feature might be accounted for on the supposition that the boulder whilst being pushed forward encountered hard obstacles which produced deep ruts on the boulder when the first of Glasgow, ea suggested by Mr Peach, what waa the transporting agent to suit those localities A glacier moving from west to east by the action of gravity wonld be hardly conceivable The level preclude that agent A sea current loaded with fighting ice seems & more probable conjecture contact took place afterwards the boulder would rise over these obstacles and in consequence the strip produced by them would diminish in depth 6. Tyrecastle, near Edinburgh.— A basalt boulder 43 x 4 x 2 feet was discovered striated on both upper and under side but the ruts were much deeper on the under side The under side rita had begun to be formed at the east end of bhoulder,—the strip on the upper side begun at the west end This might be accounted for by supposing that the boulder had been pushed towards the east over hard rocks and that floating ice from the westward had pushed stones over the upper surface The smallest end of boulder pointed towards west The sides of the boulder were wall rounded This boulder lay in a hill of muddy sand containing many pebbles of all kinds hard and soft such as quartz shale and could Height above ses 200 feet.—&d.

PERTHSHIRE. 1. Lock Fay.—On the farm of Morenish, situated on the north bank of the lake and about 2 miles from the village of Killin, there are several boulders worthy of notice Figs. 13, 14, 15, Plate II., are intended to show the positions and specialties of these holders They were at a height of about 1400 feet above the ses asking Loch Tay to is 300 feet Theee boulders had all come from the westward viz down the valley as shown by the way in which they were fixed If the question be whether they were brought by glacier or by floating ice the answer is that there is not much evidence either way It may however be remarked that if they were pushed forward by & heavy glacier it is odd that the boulders should not have been carried further down the valley and that the obstruction on their east side against which they have stuck should not have yielded under the pressure of a ponderous glacier The boulders in figs 13 and 14 were resting on detritus and pressing against detritus only on their east sides The boulders in fig 15 was pressing against a hard rocky stratum of clay slate on its east side Io several parts of the hill smoothed rock of mics schist ocenr, with knobs of quartz standing up above the general surface Being harder than the mass of rock they had resisted the friction better ; these knobs were smoothed the smooth parts being always on the weat gives Fig. 16, Plate IIL, shows a rock with joints The projecting angles facing the west have been smoothed by some trading and grinding force 2 Glen Dockart,—There are many boundary of considerable size resting on dotritas, and chiefly on the south side of the valley One near an old toll-bar measured in so far as above the ground 13 x 12 x B feet at a height of 630 feet above the sea At the small farmhouse of Wester Lix, at a height of 660 felt above the sea there is a flat or terrace partly rock partly detritus on which there are several large well-rounded boulders two of them & coarse granite probably from Ben Cruachan, On ascending the hill towards the south & holder 12x9x 5 feet was met with at a height of 1116 feet above the scan Its longer axis bore E. } 8., which is also the direction of the axis of the valley in this place There being no rocky hill near from which this boulder could have come it has certainly been brought to the spot where it now lies by some transporting agent At the height of 1250 feet there iz a mass of rock on the same side of the valley and nearer the top of the ridge which has on it some noteworthy marks The rock stands out prominently and forms a nearly vertical cliff as shown in fig 17, Plate IIL.  Oan the side facing the west there are horizontal grooving apparently formed by some force which acting on the whole mass hags worn down certain portions more than others there portions being less come pact and so more capable of abrasions Such abrasion might have been effected by a body of water passing from the westward ; and more readily than by the solid ice of a great glacier On the top of the ridge forming the south bank of this valley {Glen Dochart), a cairn stands at & height of 1600 feet above the send A boulder of considerable size lies on the top of this ridge on the east aide of a projecting knoll Has the boulder been stranded on what was the loe side of the knoll LOBS-8H1RE. At Auchnasheen (Dingwall and Strome Ferry Railway,) there is a boulder about 16 feet in girth which stands on a fat of detritus about 610 feet above the sea In this district there are several other retrial flats in eight of this one all nearly on the same level There can be no doubt that these flats have been originally one continuous plateau which formed a sea-bottom. It has been cut through by several streams the banks of which about 18 feet high show an enormous accumulation of gravel and sand ;—sand, below deposited probably when the water was deep ; gravel above deposited when the water was shallower and mare subject to currents The annexed diagram represents a portion of these remarkable flats cut through by several streams the principal of which flows from Loch Rosque,—situated to the north of the boulder The knob on the woodcut are intended to represent knoll of gravel or sand remnants of & greater mass of these materials The boulder is well rounded and it has evidently come from a distant quarter Profsssor Nicol of Aberdeen has expressed an opinion that the formation of these Auchnasheen terraces is due o the action of a great river flowing from the west I regret to differ on this point from & geological friend but I can see no grounds for that opinion To the east of Auchnasheen, close to the railway there are several spots of rock evidently rounded by friction—whether by ice or by * Nicol's Geology of Bcotland, pa 89. water or by both it is difficult to say Their height above the sea is about 780 feet On the hills on each side of the railway there are traces of horizontal lines on the detritus which deserve better observation than could be given from the railway carriage BTIRLINGSHIRE. 1. On Sheriffmuir, 3 miles from Bridge of Allan, near Blackford, there is said to be a large boulder called Wallace’s Putting Stone, NORTHUMBERLAND., It was intended that only Scotch boulders should be inquired after by the Committee; but it is not irrelevant to notice a boulder which though now in England, was probably transported from a Scotch mountain In Chillingham Park, the seat of the Earl of Tankerville, near Alnwick, there are several small boulders of granite The rocks of the immediate neighbourhood are carboniferous sandstone and lime stones The nearest point for granite is the ““ Big Cheviot,” eight miles to the W.N.W., and reaching a height of about 1800 felt above the sea The largest boulder is 3 feet 2 in length 2 feet 4 in width and 2 feet high It is round in shape and about 400 feet above the sea Several valleys and ridges of hills Iie between Chillingham and the Big Cheviot, across which the boulder must have heen trans ported to reach its present site Remarks by Davip Mnxe Home, LLD. Convener of the Society's Boulder Committee, on presenting the Commit- techs Fourth Report at a Meeting of the Society, with May 1878, 1. In presenting a Fourth Report from the Society’s Committee on Boulders, I may be allowed first to refer to the main object for which the Committee was appointed Tt was to collect data which might help towards a solution of the problem by what agency boulders in Scotland had Leen transported from the parent rocks to the positions they now occupy The Transactions of the Society contain numerous papers by eminent geologists on this question At a very early period Sir James Hall, when he drew attemp tion to many large boulders and also $0 tho remarkable appears dances called crag and tail in the midland districts of Scotland, ascribed both sets of phenomena to the agency of great bodies of water which had passed over the country from west to east At a later period about the year 1842), Agassiz and Dr Buckland started the idea that as in Switzerlend, glaciers had been the means of carrying masses of rock from the Alps across the valley of Geneva to the Jura mountains so there might in former days have been glaciers in Scotland producing similar effects More recently a third theory was started,—that if the sea stood several hundred feet above its present level Soating ice might have been the means of transporting the boulders and carrying them areat distances 2, There being thus three different theories of transport each supported by eminent geologists the Committee has endeavoured to gather facts to ascertain which theory is the most probable or whether any better can bo suggested 1 do not presume to say that the information contained in this and the previous Reports will yet allow the problem to be solved But at all events it may be conceded that some new facta have been ascertained which throw considerable light on the question I venture to indicate what appear fo me to be several con cousins warranted though in doing so T offer only my own opinion Perhaps the Committes, after more information has been obtained may be induced to consider whether they will pro bounce on the various questions of interest which the subject presents I confine myself this evening to only & few points and chiefly to illustrate what occurs in our last Report. 3. The boulders referred to in the Report may be divided into two glasses First, There are boulders which from the nature of the rock come posing them are so soft and friable that they could have been trans ported only short distances—euch as sandstone coal and shale In the Report, samples ave given of such boulders from Berwick- shire and Mid-Lothian : The second class of boulders namely such as are ascertained to have coma from remote quarters are composed of rocks hard compact and homogeneous in composition such as basalt green stone granite felspar quartz greywacke, and old conglomerate Boulders of these rocks have been found even as far as 80 or 100 miles from the.parent rocks and generally speaking they ars well rounded presenting evidence of enormous friction undergone whilst in transit and even in some cases acquiring almost spherical shape Bpecimens of small spherical boulders are now on the Society's table There are however exceptions to the rule that boulders of hard compact rocks are generally well rounded Cases of boulders of these hard rocks occur extremely angular in shape Examples are shown in this Report, by the lithographs appended to it, and in previous Reports. These angular boulders are almost invariably at high levels on the sides of mountains or near their tops  The well rounded boulders ave generally at how levels and most frequently imbedded in boulder clay 4. It will be asked whether the Committee has in any case ascend trained the parent rock from which a holder has come VOL IX. iy   “Trom, . : . 44'58 per cents *“ Salphar, . , . b214 “ Coaly matter . e 380 Deducting the coal matter the iron and sulphur would be in the proportions in which they are generally found in ‘ marcasite viz “ TIron, 456-61; and Sulphur, 54-29." As regards chemical compositions therefore the small metallic boulder may be considered as exactly agreeing with the nodules found in the Campsie coal strata This agreement in composition affords a strong ground for inferring that the boulder had been transported from Campsie, or from Kilsyth, as suggested by Mr Peach. With regard to the larger spherical ball found in the same bed of boulder clay at Leith, I am now able also to indicate the part of the country from which it was probably transported Mr Hutchison of Carlowrie, happening to see this atone ball informed me of two quarries in Linlithgowshire where concretion resembling it were in abundance These quarries are near Humbie and Dalmeny, situated from nine to ten miles due west from Edinburgh. Mr Hutchison having sent to me several of these concretion I was induced to visit Dalmeny Quarry. I found in the sandstone rock thers numerous concretion of all sizes up to nearly 4 fest in diameter Humbie Quarry I did not visit as tho working of it kad been given up and it was full of water A concretion from this lsat mentioned quarry sent to me by Mr Hutchison, Professor Crum Brown has examined with the following result;—‘ it weighs 173 be It consists externally of a thin shell of sandstone and internally of i mixture of quartz and marcasite closely red selling the substance of the large ball from Leith. The mean specific gravity of the ball was 3-49." There is thas a sufficient similarity of composition in regard to the stone ball and the Humbie concretion to make it exceedingly pro able that these Humbie sandstone rocks supplied the stone ball Ido ot sy that Humbie Quarry waa the exact spot from which the stone ball found at Leith actually came The sandstone strata which over at Humbie and Dalmeny of course crop out elsewhere in the district near South Queensferry ; all that can be said ig that The answer is that the Committee can in no case point out the particular rock from which a boulder had originally been broken off All they can affirm is that in several cases they have ascertained the district or quarter from which the boulder must have come {1.) For example in Berwickshire, as will be seen from this last Report and the second Report, particular hills dre specified from which boulders must have come The direction in which they came and the number of miles traversed are therefore in these cases matter of certainty In every case over the whole county of Berwick, from ite lowest to its highest level the direction of transport is from point between W. and N. W, (magn.) The same is the case in Mid-Lothian. The sandstone boulders at Craiglockhart are shown to have most probably come from rocks situated & few miles to the N.W, The quartz and other hard rock boulders at the same place as also at Liberton and st Leith, in like manner probably came from points between W. and N. W. {2.) The two remarkable spherical balls of marcasite found in the boulder clay at Leith and mentioned in this Report, must in like manner have come from the westward A presumption to thet effect arises from the mere fact that they are in the esme bed of clay which contains granite and other Highland rocks But there is more than presumption Mr Peach having indicated where pyrates balls might be found in sifu viz at Campais and Kilsyth, I went to Campsie last week and on inquiry was shown eome thin strata of coal abounding in nodules of pyrates several of the nodules 80 large as to weigh half a what The coal is worked for burning limestone It is too full of sulphur for domestic used Specimens of this coal with the pyrates nodules which I obtained on the spot are now on the table of the Society. Kilsyth I did not visit because the overseer at Campsia told me that he had worked at Kilsyth, and that there were pyrates nodules in the coal strata tbere similar to those at Campsie, but of rather smaller size Some of the nodules which I obtained at Campsie I submitted to Professor Crum Brown, that he might examine them to see whether they contained * marcasite Hoe has reported to me as follows :— “These nodules have i specific gravity of 412, and consist of iron sulphur and coal matter in the following proportions :— the stone ball may have come and most probably came from some part of that district Mr Peach mentions in his letters quoted in the Roport of the Committee, that similar concretionary balls occur in sandstone rocks near Burntisland, and suggests thatthe ball in question came from that quarter In that case the direction of transport would be from about due N, If the stare came from near South Queensferry, the direction would be from W.N.W,, which last would be more in accordance with the evidence of direction in dictated by many other data Assuming, then as most probable that the large stone ball as well as the small metallic ball found in the Leith boulder clay came from parent rocks situated to the westward the next guestion will be by what agency were they transported ¥ Mr Peach, in his letter apparently assumes as matter of course that these balls were transported by the agency of the But nice in what form —land-ice, or service 1 If tho metallic boulder came from Campsie, the distance over which it travelled to Leith could not have been less than 30 miles and as the Campeie coal strata are only about 150 feet above the present sea-level, there would not be gradient sufficient for i glacier either to carry on its surface or to push before it, debris of rocks from Cempsie to Leith. Moreover, Leith is not st or near the mouth of any valley which could create or guide & glacier from the west of Scotland. But there are in the Campsie and Kilsyth district marks of various kinder indicating the action of a deepsea current Thesa marks it is proper to notice as having an important bearing ou the general question of boulder transport Mr John Young of Glasgow, in the year 1868, wrote an in structure paper in the “Transactions of the Glasgow Geological Society,” on the geology of Campsie. He says page 14)—+ There are few localities in the central district of Scotland, where such an extent of polished and striated rock surface is to be seen as along the flat summits of the south hill of Campzie. The strike vary in their direction from & few points north of west to south of west according to the deflection of the ground many tracts of the sand stone rock still showing the channelled markings in great perfect tion at about 600 feet above the sea My Young then refers to the Strathblane Valley, which lies between the north and south hills of Campsie, and to the appearances indicating that it had been * swept by powerful currents of water which bave helped to produce those inequalities of surface seen along the outer margin of the trace now occupied by the rivers Kelvin and Glazert, It was during the period when Secotland sat several hundred fest lower in the ses than it does at present and when the valley of the Kelvin existed as a deep sound connecting the German and Atlantic Oceans, that those great beds of stratified sand and gravel were deposited which we now see filling up the Strath (a8 near the village of Torrance) to more than 100 feet above the level of the river At other points long its course similar opposite exist to more than 100 felt below the present sea-level, This shows that & very deep sound or valley must have originally extended across Scotlund, previous to the glacial period in this partis ocular dirsclion. A depression of the land to the extent of 350 feet would produce the following results :—The German and Atlantic Oceans wonld be united by the valley of the Kelvin, also by the valley of the Leven, Loch Lomond, and onwards by the low ground near Kippen to the Forth at Stirling. 4 narrow sound through the Campsie valley would connect the two seas as the watershed at Ballagan Bridge is only 330 feet Zhe Campwie and Kilpatrick hill would then Jorm two islands and the valleys of the Carron and the Endrick would be estuaries or arms of the sea It is only by assuming conditions such as these that we can hope to explain the superficial sedimentary deposits page 16). In the year 1871, in company with Mr Young, I had an oppose unity of visiting the Campsie district and from my notebook I make the following extracts :— - a On Craigend moors at about 4560 feet above the ses situated two miles weat of Strathblane, I found the sandstone rock present ing extensive sheets of smoothed horizontal surface evidently ground down by fricking and presenting occasional strike running in a direction 8,E. by 8. The rock had in some places imbedded in it quartz pebbles standing up above the general surface Being harder than the sandstone rock these pebbles had been able to withstand the friction ; but some of them showed marks of rubbing on their northwest sides gravel and beds of sand are abundant in the valleys of Strathblane and Campsie, he had never found any marks of grinding or striation on the rocks in these valleys These effects seemed fo have been produced at levels higher than 400 felt above the sea On another occasion when apologising on the Campsie hills above Glorat, situated 3 miles to the east of Campsie, and at a height of 800 feet above the sea I found the sandstone rock striated in a direction due E, and W. On the Kilsyth hills a few miles still farther east and at a height of 1200 feet above the ses the striations on the rocks were seen to be E. and W. go One other fact observed was the immense accumulation of boulders of ali kinds at Croyhill, a knoll of trap at the summit level between the forthe of Clyde and Forth—viz., about 160 feet above sea-level As some of these boulders were of told con glomerate,” they afford additional evidence of an agency which brought thom from the westward ke In addition fo these facts notice may be taken of two boulders reported to the Committee by Mr Jack of the Geological Survey. One is of mica slate weighing about 6 toms on the . Kilsyth hills at 1260 feet above the sea the parent rock of which Mr Jack supposes to he agitated about 16 miles to the north The other iz of conglomerate weighing about 7 tons on the north hill of Campsie, at 1803 feet above the sea with ite longer exist W, 20° N, Tta parent rock is supposed by Mr Jack to be to N.-W. (First Report of Committee, pa 51.) Now what do all these facts prove They prove that an agent of some kind or other moved over this district having i depth of at least 1800 felt and covering a great breadth of country and that whilst this agent was moving the rocks over which it passed were ground down and rutted and striated ; large boulders at a high level were carried forward and boulders at & low level were pushed in a similar direction There is an additional fact deserving notice The valley at Lennoxtown, where the pyrates coal strata are worked seems to have at one time been filled up by these strata These strata now however exist only on each side of the valley Some agent has scooped them away whereby the present valley was excavated ; and it is * « Estaary of the Forth," pa 96.   U, At this place looking towards the N.W.—viz, in the direction of Loch Lomond—an opening between the hills which are apparently about 1000 feet high was discernible this opening being about 14 mile wide ca At four other places on Craigend moors from 500 to 600 felt above the sea two to three miles apart there were striations on the rocks pointing respectively 8.E. by 8., B.E § 8, S8E by §, and 8.8 E At all these places the direction was seen to pass through the opening between the hills above referred to, indicating that the agent whatever it was which produced the striations might have come and probably came by that opening = do On this same moor forming an extensive plateau of about & miles long by about 3 miles wide I had pointed out to me by Mr Young several boulders in different places Two were of trap from the Kilpatrick hills situated some miles to the W.N.W., and at a height of 570 feet above the ses In emir cumference, each boulder measured 27 feet and o far as not buried in the drift on which they were lying the height of one was 4} feet of the other 6 fact Another boulder well rounded 500 feet above the sea was of grey granite weighing about 2 cwt., which Mr Young considered from the size of its felspar crystals to have come from Ben Awe, i mountain situated to thoe N.W., and distant about 50 miles There were several smaller boulders of old conglomerate — transported no doubt from the well-known band of that rock which running from Dumbarton, crosses Loch Lomond in e N.E. direction towards Aberfoyle. e. In the valley of the Blane there are deep beds of sand formed most probably whilst the sea occupied the valley and numerous well-rounded boulders of all descriptions At Strathblane Railway Station there was a deep cutting of a sandbanks with several boulders in the sand and one in such & position as to indicate that it had fallen from some raft which had been conveying it, as it was sticking with its narrowest point downmost.* J- It was remarked to me by Mr Young, that whilst boulders * Sce a diagram of this sandbank and boulder in u little book published by Edmonston & Douglas in 1671, called ** Estoary of the Forth,” possible that the balls found in the Leith boulder clay form a portion of the debris of these pyrates strata so broken up What agent can fit into all these conditions so well as a sea current loaded with ice ? On this theory it is intelligible why the rocks along the moors of Craigend and Craigmaddie, stretching for 5 or 6 miles in a direction S.E. and 8.8.E, at a level of from 500 to 700 feet above the sea should show more effects of grinding and striation than the rocks at a lower level Had a glacier been the agent the grinding would have been chiefly at the lowest not at the highest level The suborned plan and section of Campsie hills and valley will make the foregoing explanations more intelligible The plan is copied from a published map by Johnston. The section has been   kindly drawn for me by Mr John Young of Glasgow, who is thoroughly well acquainted with the geology of the district In his letter sending the section Mr Young says The Campsie coal and limestone is at present worked on the flank of the north hill as well as in the mine which you saw in the south hill The valley   between there hills is one of denudation. Several hundred feet of strata belonging to the Lower Carboniferous Limestone series have been removed or scooped out by currents of the ocean “If you examine Sheet 8 of the horizontal section of the Geological Survey by Professor Geikie) you will find on the south hill of Campeie the outcrop of the coal and limestone This sheet shows quite as distinctly as my sketch the valley running between the south and north hills and the great deputation of the coal strata containing the marcasite balls 1800 FX Bection across Campsie Valley ; coal and limestone strata overlaid by gravel and earth These explanations go far to show how the small marcasite ball found in the Leith boulder clay probably came from Campsie. A geological study of that district indicates the agency of deepsea currents loaded with ice which flowed upon the Campeie hills from the W.N.W., scooping out the valley which now occurs there and breaking up to a large extent the coal strata in that valley The debris of these strata would be swept along to the eastward and some of the nodules forming part of these strata would be buried in the boulder clay now existing at Leith. 4. The cases which I have just been describing are of boulders large and small which have come from remote places now separated by an intervening tract of dry land from the present site of these boulders (1.) Bat there are cases of boulders which-to reach their present sites must have crossed arms of the sea even now of considerable depth and extent In such cases the theory of local glaciers is of course scarcely conceivable Thus on the Island of Islay, the Committee's last Report refers to several large boulders of rock differing from any rock known in VOL. IX. oz the island At least such was the opinion I formed after week's ramble and after inquiring among intelligent persons well acquainted with the rocks of the island to also in the Taland of Kerrcra, opposite to Oban, there are numerous blocks of grey granite though no rocks of any kind of granite occur in the island On the small island of Staffa, consisting entirely of basalt and greenstone I found boulders of red granite and genies which probably came from the Muoll mountains situated to the N.E (Committee’s ad Rep., pa 157). {2.) In Nairnshire there are many conglomerate boulders of huge give and angular in form which must have been transported across what is now the Cromarty Firth from Roseshire. They are &t & height of from 400 to 600 feet above the sea (First Rep. of Com- mitts pa 42.) Other examples are afforded by the black granite boulders at Appin and in Loch Creran. Specimens of these are now on the table As the present Report gives a full explanation regarding these boulders I do not require to repeat how when these specie mens were submitted to Professor Judd of London, who has made the igneous rocks of the West Highlands o special study he gave his opinion that there was no rock of the same description on the mainland and that it wes to be found only in Mull. From thatisland, therefore these boulders must have been transported and across a sea which even now has at one place i depth of 100 fathoms but which transportation probably took place et a period when the sea stood hundreds or even thousands of feet above its present level or when the land sat that much lower in the ocean (3.) If Professor Judd's opinion of the Loch Creran and Appin boulders be correct it goes far beyond an explanation of the boulders in these localities For example the Island of Lismors, whose rocks are entirely limestone has on it many boulders of granite which probably also came from Mul), inasmuch as Lismore lies between Mull and Appin (Com. ad Rep., pa 167). In Lochaber there ia the hill called Craig Dhu, about 2000 feet in height so called I believe from tho great number of black granite boulders resting on and near its top These boulders on account of their peculiar colour as well a position attracted the notice of Professor Nicol and Mr Jamisson; and they sre mentioned in both of my recent papers “ Op the Parallel Roads.” (See also Committee’s First Report, pa 39.) In these papers I had occasion to point out how the position of the boulders both in Glen Roy and Glen Bpean indicated that they had come—not doin these glens but up the glens If the boulders st Loch Creran were rafted on ice from Mull by & sea current flowing eastward the position of the boulders in Glen Roy and Glen Spean could be explained in the same way (4.) There is another fact connected with the position of boulders in the West Highlands, and indeed over Scotland generally which receives explanation from Professor Judd's paper “ On the Ancient Volcanoes of the Hebrides,” I mean the high position of many large boulders ' In the Committee’s Second Report notes is taken of a remark by the Ordvance Surveyors up 1567), that in the Stratherrick district where the highest hills are about 2900 feet above the sea the boulders on the sides of these hill extend down to a level of about 2250 fest Fut not lover In Fortingall parish (Perthshire) a gneiss boulder weighing above 400 tons is Iying on clay slate rocks at a height of 2500 feet being very near the ridge of clay slate hill The gneiss hills form e range about 20 miles to the north and northwest (Committec’s First Report, pa 49.) On the Fennoch Mountains (Roes-ghire) a gneiss boulder of about 130 tons weight lies on a watershed at & height of 2000 feet above the ses (Committee's First Report, pa 49.) On Schehallion {Perthshire) blocks of grey granite are seen al 2 height of 3000 feet (Committee’s Second Report, pa 173.) On the top of a hill in Lochsber, exceeding 3000 feet above the sea there are genite boulders (Paper on DParallel Roads, Tr. of Boe. vole xvii pa 740.) Now where are there at present in Scotland ranges of mountain from which fragments could have been transported to such height as those above named 3 There are now none such Isolated peaks there are but none exceeding 4300 feet ; and of these there is but one in the Weet Highlands (Ben Nevis), though it is from the westward that the great bulk of the boulders which overspread Scotland have come Professor Judd’s paper giving reasons for believing that there were in Pliocene times mountain in Bkye, Mall, Ardnawurchan, and even in Rum, some of which reached to i height of at least 14,000 feet solves the difficulty and explains many other curious facts besides For example there is a series of granite boulders containing unusually large crystals of quarter felspar and mica which occupy the strath between Fort-William and Kingussie. A boulder near Fort-William is 1600 feet above the sea and from its position appears to have necessarily alighted oo the hill from the westward (Committee’s ad Report, pa 161-2). If the sea stood at 2000 feet or more above the present level the valley of Locliebsr and the Spey would be occupied by sea and through them a current could flow from the ocean on the west to the ocean on the east The summit level now between Lochaber and Strathspey is 860 feet shove the sea to that if the climate at that time was such as to allow of glaciers among the mountains and of floating ice on the scan there would be mean of transporting boulders from Mull to Lochaber and Strathspey. B, Thero are several other instructive features connected with boulders brought out in this as well as in previous Reporta. " {1.) The different shapes of boulders The Appin boulders are round shaped whilst the Loch Creran boulders are angular though the rock composing them is the mme The former are known in the district ag * the round atone of Appin." These Appin boulders are on the shore of the Linnhe Loch, through which in former times there must always have been a rapid current flowing between the high mountain forming the Glen-na-Albin or Great Glen of Seotland. If icebergs then floated om the sea these boulders must have undergone much pushing and rolling whereas the Loch Creran boulders being in what would then be only an arm or inlet from the main channel would be exposed to no such friction In reference to the Kyle or sea straits in what is now the line of the Caledonian Canal, the grinding to which the rocks on the sides of the valley have been subjected is well seen st Cullochy on the north side and at Inverfarrignig on the south side of the canal {2.) Another common feature presented by boulders in Seot- laud is that when they are longer than they are broad the longer axis iz parallel with the direction in which the boulder had been transported Very frequently also when one end i sharp and the other end broad the former points towards the direction from which the boulder has come On the theory of icebergs and floating ice this feature is intelligible on any glacier or ice chest theory it is not (3.) The existence of strip on boulders and the circumstance that these strike are sometimes deeper at one edge than on the rest of the surface is & new fact brought out in this last Report page 688). 6. In several part of the Report allusion is made to the evidence which boulders seem to afford of the enormous deputation which there must have been in the district where these boulders are situated app 662-667). 7. Notice is also taken in two districts of the West Highlands of horizontal terraces on the sides of hilly up to a height of 1800 fest above the sea If these are to be ascribed to seas action as suggested in the Report, they would only show that Scotland possesses tha same features in this respect ma Norway, Sweden, and Americs, where there are horizontal terraces to even greater height It is only reasonable to expect that in the north of Scotland such records of the ocean should be discernible considering the enormous beds of sand and gravel found at great heights in many of the mount taint On Schehallion (Com. ad Rep., pa 173) there is gravel up to & height of at least 3000 feet In reference to the suggestion that these terraces on the sides of mountain in the Highlands are marine it is not unimportant to observe that similar horizontal terraces at high levels occur also in lowland districts Mr James Geikie, in his “ Great Ice Age,” refers to a series of high level terraces of gravel and sand at Eaglesham,” about 12 miles 8. W. of Glasgow, the highest being 800 feet above the sea [ have also traced them he adds page 248), on the Moorfoots, up to 1030 or 1100 feet and these like the Eaglesham beds seem equally to require the agency of the ses Still farther south high lovel shelves of gravel and sand have been started by my colleagues Mr Skae, in Nithadale, at a height of 1250 fest above the sea 8. Lastly, may I be permitted as there is still & wide field for farther investigation to express a hope that the Boulder Committee may be reappointed and with additional labourers to carry on the work I will be happy to be allowed to remain on the Committes, but T wish to resign the honour of being Convener. I begin to find that I ara now not able for the hill-climbing aud trudging across Highland moors and morsases, which boulder-hunting requires   Edinburgh, 24tk May 1878.
