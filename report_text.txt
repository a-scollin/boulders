  1. On the east side of Lochlong, opposite to Ardentinny, there ie the farm of Peston. On this farm i burn descends from a sheepish hill which feces the north A gneiss boulder lice in i gorge out by the Larn through rocks of clay slate The boulder     rests on the rocky sides of the burn jammed in between the sides The boulder has some local came like *“ Jenny Meullen,” meaning “ House on a knoll The eight of the boulder above the ses is about 226 feet Its distance from the sea-beech is about three quarters of & miles The size of the boulder is about 24 x 18 x 12 felt It is most probable that the boulder was transported across tho loch from the north or northwest and was arrested in its further progress southward by the hill on the north side of which it stand Two sketches of this boulder are given on Plate II. figs 1 and 2. 2. Between the site of this boulder and the sea-beach an old ses margin occurs at @ height of about 45 feet above the sea medium level A number of boulders lie along the line of this ses margin There is in old sea margin on the opposite or west side of the loch at exactly the came height—viz., 45 feat 3. Close to the beach in this part of Lochlong —i.e., about 8 or 9 feet above high-water market a place called “ Letter,” there lies another gneiss boulder 12 x 8 x 8 feet Its long diameter points N.W. by N.—viz, to Glenfinnart Valley. 4. Very near this boulder about 100 yards to the north the clay slate rocks have been ground down and smoothed Their smoothed surfaces show numerous strike pointing N., 2° or 8° W, (magnetic). The smooth surface dips towards the north at an angle of 3° or 4°. 5. On the hill above Carrick Castle, situated on Lochgoil, there is a boulder called *‘Clach udelain,” or the “Stone nicely balanced It is at & height of 1626 feet above the sea This boulder is of gneiss and lies on rocks of clay slate It lies on a bare rock the face of which slopes to N.N.E.—s.e., towards Lochgoil. The boulder i within three or four yards of the edge of & precipitous rocky cliff which goes vertically down about 500 or 600 feet The block is of enormous size Unfortunately the note taken of its dimensions has been lost This boulder from its position could not have fallen from any hill There is no hill near it from which it could have failed A sketch of this boulder is given on Plate 1L fig 3. 6. The next boulder visited is about two miles to the eastward of the lest-meuntioned, and is within a quarter of & mile of Lochgoil, neer its junction with Lochlong. It is about 450 feet above the sea It my be observed that all the rocks in this district have their smooth faces towards the north their rough faces towards the south This boulder has received the name of the “Giant's Put ting-Stone,” from & legend which alleges that in former times there were giants who inhabited the district on both sides of Loch- long and who were in the practice of amusing themselves by throw ing these huge boulders across the loch Therock on which it rests slopes gently N. by E. This rock presents a large surface ground down and smoothed The space of rock occupied by the superimposed boulder is only 18 inches by 12 inches It would not be dificult for two men with strong levers to move the boulder from its narrow resting-place, in which case the boulder would probably roll down the steep hillside into the loch Two sketches of this boulder are given on Plate ITI. figs 4 and 5. 7. To the north of Knep Farm-house, there is a small hill on or very neer the top of which eight or ten boulders are clustered They suggest the idea that this hill hes arrested or interrupted the body whatever that body was which transported the boulders and caused them to be stranded here 8. There is another hill lower down the valley of Knap about 480 feet above the ses the top of which consists of olay late rocks rounded and smoothed by some agent passing over from the worth It has received the popular name of the “ Pig's Back.” Several boulders lie on this ridge The largest rest on a very small portion of rock A sketch of this ridge of rock with boulders on it, is given on Plate III. fig 6. 9. Pulag boulder is near the top of a hill to the west of Glen- finnart about 824 feet above the sea It is a large black of gneiss about 7 feet high There ere many other smaller boulders lying near it, The large boulder is almost on the edge of a precipice which goes down at least 200 feet It could not have been rolled or pushed to its present position The levels of the district show the greatest openings towards the north circumstance which suggests that the boulder came from the north Moreover, its south end costs on & smaller boulder which seeme to have stopped its progress further south A sketch of this boulder is given on Plate III. fig 7. 10. Along various parts of the hills in this district where their highest ranges are seen against the eye and ot & height of about 2000 feet above the sea boulders are discernible from a distance lying on the ridges It would be very desirable to obtain particular accounts of boulders at so high an elevation 11. In the last Report of the Committee, notice was taken of & boulder in Ayrshire called the * Hunterston Boulder.” Along the same cost sud especially on the property of Mr Alexander of Boydstone, several very large boulders may yet be seen One, called the ** Boydstone Rock or Stone,” is situated about two miles northwest of Ardrossan. Some chips of the boulder sent to the Convener in a lottery show that it is porphyritic. The rocks on this part of the coast are Old Red Sandstone. The boulder is in length about 19 feet and in breadth about the same It is partly buried in the mud of the shore Its highest point is 9} feet above the shore It is said to contain 40 cubic yards above the shore line It is supposed that the boulder is buried to the depth of 5 feet The tide st high water leaves about 3 feet of the boulder visible This boulder has inspired the poetic genius of an Ayrshire letter-carrier (Maloolm Kerr, post-messenger between Ardrossan end West Kilbride), who through Mr Weir of Kirkhall, has sent to the Convener the following stirring address :— To the Great Boulder on the shore opposite to the lands of Boydstone, two miles north of Ardrossan, Ayrshire. ** Can'st thou speak old grey stone Unto me ! List then to the oceans moans I to thee : Music sweet [ Spirits string Wild ditties a they cling To the big waves which swing Aroand thee Stranger | whence didst then come To this shore 1 Art thou an Arctic crumbs ‘Which of yore On some huge iceberg side From thy first home did glide A wanderer on the tide To this whore ! Many eyes with wonder Ages gone Looked on thes ! What number Yet unknown Will gare with curious eye, Secking to know thy history And solve 8 hidden mystery Old grey stone Besides the boulder which inspired these verses there are two others also on Mr Alexander’s property—one of them as Mr Woeir states “ even larger than the big stone at Brigurd, at Hunter- stone This larger one it was proposed to split up for building purposes at Ardrossan; but Mr Alexander interfered and saved it. There sre many other boulders along the Ayrshire sea-cosst, but none so large as the Boydstone boulder A chip of one of these santa show that it is of gneiss indicating a northern origin 12. A report has been received of i gneiss boulder near Dun- blane on the property of Cromlix, belonging to the Hon. Captain Drummond. The length of the boulder is stated to be 17} feet ita breadth on an average 10, its height about 5 feet Its longer axis lies in & direction southwest and northeast At ite south end it die into the ground at an angle of 45°. Its weight above ground is estimated at 34 tons Its eight above the ses is about 450 feet It is about four miles south from the Grampians. The same reporter (Henry Wilkie, Ashfield Worke, Dunblane) reform to i group of four boulders in the parish of Redgorton, at the west end of a gravel ridge on the farm of Bertha, the property of Murray Grabam, Eeq. of Murrayehall. Three of these Redgorton boulders are within an area of 30 yards They are angular fiat on the top and some of them square They seem to be Silurian rocks They are distant about twelve miles from the Grampians. 13. Notice has been received by the Convener from Mr Robert- son C.E., who is in charge of the Albert New Docks at Leith, that boulder clay was found in excavating for the looks beneath the shore line to the depth of about 70 feet The clay was full of large blocks Some of these were of sandstone weighing 10 or 12 tons and appeared to be of the same rock is that worked at Granton and Craigleith Quarries to the westward Beneath the boulder olay there was found what the engineers call & running and " lying over strata of shale and sandstone Before concluding the Committee may advert to the circumstance that a part of the district comprehended in this Report was many years ago described by an eminent Scotch geologist—the late Charles M‘Laren—and with reference to the very matters embraced in this report Mr M‘Laren read papers in this Society, in the years 184647, describing the boulders then existing.on the shores of the Gairloch, and on the hills between that loch and Lachlong. Even then the destruction of boulders in that quarter had begun being appropriated as Mr M‘Laren states to building purposes and probably by this time they heve all been annihilated Mr M‘Laren in these papers described also the striation and smoothing of the rocket which he found from the seashore up to the hope of the ridges between the Gairloch and Lochlong, st heights of about 1000 feet above the sea Itis due alike to the memory of our Associate, and Lo the interests of geological science to mention that the boulders referred to by him as found on the Gairloch, consisted of grey granite of which he counted above a hundred one-third of them exceeding 30 tons in weight i also mia slate which though less numerous had had song them blocks of 60 and 80 tons in weight As the rocks of the Gairloch in sifu are of a more recent kind—viz. clay slate—Mr M'Laren justly inferred that the boulders were of northern origin For those of granite he pointed to Ben Cruachan, & mountain exceeding 3000 feet in height situated to the NNN.W., and distant about thirty miles The mica late hills are also in the some direction somewhat more distant From his study of the boulders and other phenomena in this district Mr M‘Laren drew two important conclusions One conclusion west that the boulders must bave been brought to the district from the parent mount trains across valleys and ranges of hills on ice floating on i sea which stood from 1500 to 2000 feet above the present sea-level, and in which a strong current had prevailed from the NN-W. This con clusion, it will be noticed is confirmed by the facts specified in the VUL IX. a present Beport, and also in former Reports by the Committee. The numerous instances given in these Reports of huge boulders shown by their composition to be of northern rocks clustered frequently on the summit or peak of hills at heights of 1500 and 2000 feet above the present sea-level, seem to leave no doubt regarding the soundness of that conclusion to which Mr M‘Laren had come to thirty years ago The other conclusion to which Mr M‘Laren came and which many good geologists of the present day hold was thia that local glaciers bad at one time existed in all those valleys This be inferred from observing that the striations on the rocks were all as he thought exactly parallel with the axis of the valley and which here generally runs in & direction northwest and southeast ; and also from discovering accumulations of gravel and clay in the form of elongated embaukments—some across the valleys others parallel with the valleys reminding him of the lateral and terminal moraine of Switzerland. Abs to the soundness of this second conclusion or the correctness of the observations an which it was founded the Committee give no opinion None of the members of the Committee have visited the localities and their function is a Committee hes been chiefly to collect facts connected with the boulders But it may mot be out of place to record the fact that another of our Associates, the late Bobert Chambers, who had also given much attention to this branch of geological science went to examine the districts referred to by Mr M‘Laren, and expressed doubts regarding these lest mentioned views In two papers read by him in this Society in December 1852, Ohambers states that on the rocky ridge between Lochlong and Holy Lach, at a height of 600 feet above the sea the direction of the striations was not parallel with the valley but “ planting over the hill ;” and as the striations were not merely on the sides of the valleys but on the tops of the hilly ranges dividing the valleys he thought they were more probably due to e general glaciation of the country than to local glaciers Chambers quotes also the opinion of Sir Roderick Murchison, “ thet there is no imaginable centre for the issue of glaciers of the ordinary kind down the Gairloch.” On this point the Committee offer no opinion and wish only to advert Lo the investigations of eminent Sootoh geology   gifts who in former days attempted a solution of these difficult quest tions The Committee would venture to suggest a reexamination of the localities a the fuller knowledge now possessed on these subjects may possibly throw a clearer light on the phenomenal The Committee wish only to add that if any geologists whether fellows of this Society or not happen in the course of their rambles through the country to fall in with or heer of any boulders red remarkable for size position or composition not yet mentioned in the Committee’s Reports, the Convener will be happy to receive a notice of them A After some conversation in which Mr Ferguson of Kinmundy, Dr Bryce, the Rev, T. Brown, and others took part the Report was adopted and the proceedings terminated
