No rock like that of boulder nearer than Belhelvie, 10 miles.to north ar Huntly, 40 miles to N.W., or Ballater, about 40 miles W.S.W. Dr Cruick- shank having in July 1870, got notice of the boulder made it known to late Professor Nicol, who caused it to be split and the striated part set up in court of Marischall College. (First Report, pa 21, and letter to Convener from Dr Cruickshank). A syenite boulder 5 x 3 x.1} feet with strike parallel:to longer axis built into a wall in King Street- Road., In Aberdeen newspaper of November 1881, account given of granite boulder weighing about 8 tons at the east end of Urquhart Road, fountain excavating a bed of sand Mounds and ridges of shingle and gravel all water rolled abound north of Aberdeen, near shore Large boulders of trap granite and gneiss rest on top and surfaces of these ridges Foveran.—In a field on Drums Farm, a huge granite boulder called “ The Grey Stone,” measuring 54 feet in circumference with a height of 7 feet above ground Another block also apparently a transported mass measures 78 feet in circumference and projects 6 feet out of ground A little to the north of Drums, on one of these gravel ridges lies a boulder 8 x 5 feet A Iayer of red clay about 9 inches thick ovaries the . gravel Boulder rests on gravel but clay over the gravel encircles its base (Seventh Report, pa 39).

In Boddam Dean, a granite boulder called “ The Hanging Stons,” 37 feet in girth and 27 feet over it, *Half a mile east another of 20 tons Muge granite boulder called the ‘ Grey Stone of Ardendraught,” was broken up in the year 1779 to build walls of a new parish church It was the stone on which “ all Hallow fires used to be lighted (First Report, pa 2), Braemar.—There is a hill close to village named ¢ Cairn-a- Drochet,” reaching an elevation of 2700 feet Near the top of the hill viz about 70 yards to the north lies a block of coarse granite 12 feet long with many other boulders of the same kind The rocks of the upper part of the hill consist not of granite but of quartzite gneiss Opinion expressed by Mr Jamieson of Ellon, that the large block and many of the others near it, came from mountains to the north the granite of which is identical with that of the boulders In letter to Convener, Mr Jamieson mentions that near shooting lodge on this hill there is a cluster of four or five immense granite boulders touching one another (First Report, pa 22, and Seventh Report, pa 41). Ben Uarn More forms the culminating peak of the great ridge of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84. 771 that divides the shires of Aberdeen and Perth, reaching to a height of 3587 feet Mr Jamieson found blocks of a peculiar porphyry on the northern slope of the hill near the top but no such rock exists there in stew The rock of the hill is quartz (1bid.). Chapel Garioch.—Boulder19 x 154 x 111 feet weighing about 250 tons Longer axis E. and W.

Kemnay.—Seven large boulders of gneiss whilst rocks adjoining are granite The largest weighs about 380 tons Most of them lie on hillsides facing W. and N.W. The gneiss hills of Bennachie and Cairnwilliam from which these boulders are supposed to have come are situated towards W.N.W. and N.W., distant 6 or 8 miles The valley of Don is between these hills and the boulders On Quarry Hill, situated not far from these boulders to north rock striations show movement from west (First Report, pa 24, and Second Report, pa 148).. To the S.E. of the above boulders another bluish-grey granite boulder called ““ Soutar's Stone,” weighing about 270 tons Height above sea about 3500 feet Lies in muddy sediment on a hillside facing N.W. A hill running N. and S. for §00 yards lies to N.'W., about a quarter of a mile distant and with ridge about 100 feet above boulder If boulder came from N.W., it must have been carried across top of this hill which is very improbable or else have come round one end and have been carried by an eddy into its present position (Second Report, pa 148).

Jamieson, Ellon from Quarterly Journal of London Geological Society, Tth Feb, 1866) :— (1) On coast south of Fraserburgh, there are several localities where the rocks are smoothed and striated in such a way as to show a movement over them from 40° N. to 60° W. | (2) In the neighbourhood of Peterhead (at Invernettie Brick- work many boulders of red and grey sandstone and also of a tough greenish coloured stone all which resemble rocks that occur in Caithness, but not in the adjoining parts of Aberdeenshire (Furst Report, pa 29), (3) At King-Edward, there are deep masses of stratified pebble mud of a dark grey coiolir, very hard and firm containing stones some of which are ice-worn and striated and fragments of shells which are likewise occasionally scratched It is like the Caithness drift in every respecf.”#“ Besides this coarse stony mud there are some beds of fine stratified sand which often contain remains of shells in considerable abundance most of them broken but many of them entire,”—* There is another bed of fine dark grey silt free from stones containing arctic shells entire and apparently 7 situ with the epidermis on The Tellina malaria occurs here of large size with both valves connected by the ligament and shut of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84., 773 ARGYLESHIRE. Kintyre.—(1) At Southend, and also along east coast south of Campbelton, the Convener saw and examined a number of boulders of a whitish-grey colour which the schoolmaster considered to be granites adding that he knew of no rocks of that nature in Kintyre. The Convener found pebbles of same rock in gravel pits at Campbelton, and was there informed that rock of same nature occurs to the north of Campbelton. Professor Nicol of Aberdeen, when he visited Kintyre, saw these boulders and thought they had been transported from Arran, where there is rock of the same kind ; in which case they must have travelled 25 miles across the deep hollow of Kilbrennan Sound in a direction from N.E. (Quarterly Journal of London Geological Society, vole viii pa 422). About a mile to east of Campbelton, smoothed rocks occur dipping or sloping N.N.W.—as if smoothing agent had come from that quarter (Stxth Report, pa ). (2) Near Kilhenzie, a few miles west of Campbeélton, a hill reach ing to a height of from 500 to 600 feet is covered with drift and on its western slopes with heist and mica slate boulders several weighing above 150 tons \ Old Red Sandstone rock on west coast covered with drift ; and on the drift boulders of granite and gneiss Diagram given in Stxth Report, representing these on a bank sloping down N.N.W. towards sea at angle of 25°, A boulder of gneiss found lying on mica schist strata blocked at south end its longer axis lying N. by E, and S. by W. Boulder said to have come from north (ZLéthograph No. 1, Plate VIIL). In a fissure of the mica slate strata on the seashore of west coast near Tangy Burn the fissure running N.'W. and S.E.), a boulder of hard gneiss weighing about 15 tons has fallen into the fissure It presses on S5:'W. wall of fissure showing that the boulder had pro baby come from some N. or N.E. point Fissure about 6 feet wide A chip of one of the granite boulders found on west coast having been submitted to Professor Heddle, he said that it was a peculiar variety well known in the Mourne Mountains in the N.E. of Ireland, on account of there being frequently in it crystals of topaz In the chip from Kintyre, sent to him by Convener, the Professor 774 Proceedings of the Royal Society Loch Long.—On ridge about 350 feet above sea between fhis Loch and Gareloch, there are several boulders of mica slate Largest 11 x 6 x 6 feet The rocks in situ are clay slate Longer axis in most is N. by E., parallel with Loch Long valley Two of boulders blocked at south ends In the Gareloch, on east beach a little below Shandon, a gneiss boulder 18 x 15 x 12 feet (240 tons with sharp end pointing N.W. At that end surface is smoothest south end surface is rough In Therd Boulder Report up 5), reference made to an account of the grey granite boulders seen by the late Charles Maclaren, amount ing in number to several hundreds one weighing 30 tons Mr Maclaren inferred that these had all come from N.N.W. The opinion of Dr Robert Chambers and Sir Roderick I. Murchison also referred to. On east side of the loch opposite to Ardentinny, gneiss boulder called ¢ Jenny Meullens,” weighing about 380 tons lying jammed in a gorge formed by rocky banks of a rivulet (Lithograph No. 2, Plate VIIL). Seemed from position to have come from north (Third Bowlder Report, pa 1). Another gneiss boulder 12 x 8 x 8 feet with longer axis N.W. by N. Strize on rocks adjoining run N, 2° or 3° W.

On summit of range of hills separating Loch Fyne and Loch Awe, ~ about 1800 feet above sea the rocks present a well-rounded and   * Whilst these sheets are being printed the Convener has had the pleasure of receiving a communication from W. Anderson Smith of Ledaig (Argyleshire), enclosing for perusal and inspection a Memoir by him entitled ** Benderloch Boulders, along with fifteen sheets of Illustrations.” Benderloch is the name of the district in Argyleshire situated between Lochs Etive and Creran, and in which the highest point is Ben Breac, 2338 feet Mr Anderson Smith, in his letter accompanying the Memoir, mentioned that as it is intended to be read during the present session of the Glasgow Geological Society, he wishes it 2       of Edinburgh, Session 1883—84. 777 smooth surface Direction of trading forces there is from N.N.E, Remarked that in this case glacier action impossible ;” and that apparently the peak had been a rocky islet on which floating ice bergs drifted “On some of the lower ridges towards Loch F one there are remarkable examples of large blocks of granite perched upon the very summits in positions which it is impossible to suppose them to have attained by any other means than by transportation upon ice (Duke of Argyll, Proceedings of Reyal Society of Edinburgh, vole will pa 457). Loch Awe.~——(1) About a mile south of Port Sonnachan, a perched boulder of compact gneiss 13 x 12 x 6 feet stands on a narrow ridge of soft mica schist in a peculiarly precarious position Its longer axis N. and S. Its height above sea 1026 feet Sides of hill to the ridge so steep that Convener could with great difficulty climb up to the ridge There being no higher hills near supposed that boulder could have come only by floating ice and from north where there is the greatest opening (Lithograph No. 7, Plate VIIL.

W. One small boulder seen on west side of rocks as if intercepted by rock in its progress eastwards Difficult to say how or from what direction smoothing effected May have been by heavy mantle of ice sliding over rocks from hills to N.E. The concentric ruts are numerous and of various diameters and depths some even 2 feet across The straight rut issuing from centre and across circular ruts generally though not always follows downwards slope of rock (Venth Report, pa 10).

The smoothed rock surfaces here dip down towards S. by E., South, 5.8.E., and S.E. Where the rock slopes down 8.E.; the surface is not striated only smoothed The rock has been most severely striated on its surface sloping down 8. and 8. by E. Some of the strike more deeply cut at one end than at the other viz at their west ends where some as much as 3 inches wide The starting agent had therefore moved from W. by S., o from due West. Portions of the smoothed surface were broken into small cup shaped hollows containing hard pebbles firmly compacted probably samples of the tools which effected the striations see Ninth Report, pa 9, and Lithograph No. 11, Plate VIIL.). The hill to the east consists of a ridge running about E. and W, and rising to a height of about 600 feet TIts north flank slopes steeply down towards Lioch Sweyn, and i covered by boulders in immense numbers and some of great size The hill slope faces down N.N.W.; but almost all the boulders lie with their longer axis pointing W.N.

Little Cumbrae Island.—On highest part of island about 400 feet above sea rocks in situ (claystone trap sloping down towards N.W., have been smoothed by some heavy agent passing over them from N. by W. Several boulders of Old Red Conglomerate found The largest is about 5 feet square and rests on rock with so small a basis that it can be rocked known by the name of ‘“Bell Stane.” Rev. Mr Lytteil suggested to Convener that name may have been originally ““ Beltane,” on account of fires lighted on it in Pagan times Close of Edinburgh, Session 18833—84. 791 to this block there is another Conglomerate boulder of smaller size with an ancient cup-shape hollow on its surface apparently artificial 4 inches in diameter and % inch deep Height above sea 190 feet (Sixth Report, pa 25).

Rock on which it lies is Carboniferous sandstone These two boulders must have been carried,—there being no adjoining hill rom which they could fall Goatfell bears from them W. by S., and is distant about 3 miles By a glacier they could not have been carried as they are not in a valley or near any valley from which a glacier could have issued (Sixth Report, pa 21). (3) To the north of Corrie, about 2 miles the road passes a large boulder on the seashore called the ¢ Catstane,” whose weight is esti mated at 362 tons 792 Proceedings of the Royal Society Near this boulder there is a granite boulder with a weight of about 212 tons Its longer axis lies N. and S., the narrowest end being to the north | (4) There is another granite boulder on the old sea-beach, at a height of 12 feet above high water It rests on Conglomerate strata which dip towards the south It is blocked at south end by a knob of Conglomerate rock which seems to have obstructed it in its progress from the north see Diagram in Siaxth Report, ply xixo fig be also Lithograph No. 9, Plate VIIL). Many blocks of this Conglomerate Sandstone have been carried along the shore southwards none found tothe north (5) On the hills west of Corrie. there are rocks with strike on smoothed surfaces at a height of 158 feet above sea The direction of the strike is N.W. and S E. On these hills up to 587 feet above the sea there are many boulders,—mostly of grey granted and a few of Conglomerate. Between those his and Goatfell there is a deep valley well strewed with granite blocks Most of them are rounded On west side of valley hill climbed to a height of about 1270 feet One boulder attracted attention being 23: feet long 9 feet wide and 12 feet high (184 tons This, and many others lay with longer axis N. and S. Its position showed that it had not fallen from any hill and must have been carried to its present site (6) In crossing to Loch Ranza, Convener saw to the south of the high road numerous perched blocks on the tops and ridges of the hills at heights of ffom 1506 to 2000 feet above the sea He regretted not being able to examine them They were most numerous on hill slopes facing N. W.: '~ The absence of boulders in Brodick Bay, whilst they abound along the shore to the north and south invites special explanation If a glacier descended from Goatfell, boulders should have been numerous in the bay and valley leading up from it to Goatfell. If the boulders came on floating ice from the N. or N.N.E. they would be dropped along the east shore and on the hill slopes facing the north But they would be deflected from Brodick Bay, by a high ridge of rocks which comes down from Goatfell to the north of Brodick Bay (Sixth Report, pa 22). (7) Beds of fine clay in south end of Arran first described by of Edinburgh, Session 188384, 793 Rev. Mr Watson) contain Arctic shells sometimes in a broken or crushed state This fossiliferous stratum is covered by a great thick ness of what Mr Watson calls boulder clay but which Messrs Bryce and Croskey call upper drift beds The upper stuff also contains broken shells (Jamzeson in paper published in Proceedings of London Geological Society of February 1866, pa 276). Bute Island.—FEast coast north of Rothesay, examined and a list of boulders found there given They consist chiefly of schisms lying on Old Red Sandstone and clay slate rocks,~—and must have come from the hills to the north (Seventh Report, pa 14). Along west coast north of Ettrick Bay, there are numerous boulders also of schisms which show by their positions that they also came from north Several of these boulders are standing on end leaning against rocks on their east sides (Sewventh Report, pa 16) (Lithograph No. 12, Plate VIIL.). Barone Hill, situated about 3 miles S. W. of Rothesay, at a height above the sea of about 500 feet has at its west end a rocky gorge with remarkable strike on sides which indicate passage through gorge of a powerful current of some kind hurrying through it from a northerly point stones and rubbish A diagram given of some of the tried showing that they have been incised more deeply at north ends than elsewhere in consequence probably of the pebbles becoming blunted by friction by being squeezed against the rock This spot is referred to in a paper “ On Glacial Drift in Scotland,” by Professor Geikie, who gives it as his opinion that ¢ the abrasion of these Barone Hill rocks has been done by an agent which came up the steep northern face ofthat eminence went right over its summit and pursued its course down into the next valley beyond The striations the Professor adds run from N, 15° W, to N. 20° E.” (Seventh Report, pa 20) (Lithograph No. 13, Plate VIIL).

Differs from any rock in locality It marked where it stood boundary between two parishes and two estates It has lately been blasted into four fragments of which three still remain (Zighth Report, pa 8). Mr Jamieson of Ellon, having examined Keiss Harbour, states that a bed of “drift,” 40 feet thick is there the lower half of which consists of stratified sandy mud containing broken shells and stones some of which are scratched The scratches and grooves point N, 35° to 40° W, Scrabster Harbour.—Mr Jamieson reports that here the boulder clay is more than 100 feet thick It is charged with small stones more or less rubbed and scratched He found in it fragments of shells Wick.—Three boulders each weighing from 20 to 30 tons One is a Conglomerate, supposed to have come from hills 20 miles to south But Rev. Mr Joass states that Conglomerate rock occurs_to west ward at less distance | Wick Bay.—Mr Jamieson found here a similar bed of boulder clay containing fragments of shells and numerous large waterwort boulders of sandstone quartzose, mica slate and granite on which glacial scoring are well marked One granite boulder was 12 feet in length (First Report, pa 80, and Proceedings of London Geological Society, Tth February 1866, pa 265). In the same paper Mr Jamieson states that in Caithness generally the shells as a rule in the clay beds and drift are broken DBut exceptions occur He himself found one entire valve of Astarte Borealis,; and he saw several entire specimens in local collections He adds that one of the objects he had particularly in view was to note the direction of the glacial markings on the rocks and fo ascertain whether they could be accounted for by a move ment of ice proceeding from the interior of the country towards the coast I therefore lost no opportunity of noting the bearings of of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84., 795 scratches whenever I saw them Mr Jamieson then gives the bearings at twenty localities in Caithness, from which he concludes that the movement had been from N.W. to S.E.; and he adds that a movement of ice from N.W. to S.E. across Caithness is totally at variance with the notion of the scratches having been caused by glacier action proceeding from the interior of the country towards the present coast In a footnote Mr Jamieson adds that ¢ the presence of marine organisms in the Caithness drift and the direction of the glacial strike which indicate a movement from the N.W., where there is now nothing but open sea for an immense distance together with the absence of moraine are all suggestive of marine conditions having prevailed during the deposition of the Caithness drift In year 1828, the late Sir Roderick Murchison published a paper in Proceedings of London Geological Society, in which he men tions that the highest hills in the Brora district afford upon their sides and summits distinct traces of a strong alluvial current which has swept them free of covering matter and deposited in the plain of Clyne, Milltown, a mass composed of the debris of the denuded hills A large portion of the turf having been recently removed the surface of the rock was seen to be scored with parallel lines The direction of the markings is uniformly from N.N.W. to S.S.E.” DUMBARTONSHIRE.

Nearest mica schist hills about 5 miles to N, and W. If boulder came from that direct tion it must have been carried across hills from 1000 to 2000 feet high If it came from north down Loch Lomond valley it must after coming so far have changed its course and moved at right angles to westward to gain its present site (Second Report, pa 153, Fourth Report, pa 20).

Several boulders of granite and gneiss on hill (Second Report, pa 155). Mr William Jolly, Inspector of Schools, Inverness, sent to the Committee valuable notes regarding the distribution and parentage of Morayshire boulders which are given in Fifth and Sixth Reports. | He says There would seem to be two varieties of Conglomerate boulders distributed through the ¢ Laigh of Moray.’” One variety is a Conglomerate, containing a dark purplish or liver-coloured quartzite in pieces of considerable size Great rocks of it occur on both banks of Loch Ness, and especially in the hill situated on the north bank called Mealfourvonie, reaching to a height of 3060 feet This rock breaks into cubical-shaped mosses and probably has produced the remarkable boulders in the counties of Nairn, Moray, and Banff, known as * Culloden or Cumberland Stone,” -+ Tom Reoch,” “ Clach-an-Oidhe” or “Stone of the Virgin,” 20 x 15 x 9 feet close to Geddes Public School. *“ Grey Stone” in Caw- dor woods,—* Clach-na-Calliach,” or ¢ Stone of the Witch,”— “ Clach-nan-Gllean or Bog’s-stone,” and various others The other variety of Conglomerate rock found in boulders in the of Lidvnburgh, Session 1883-84. 799 same counties * consists of more angular components and is entirely without the liver-coloured quartzite or porphyry ;” Mr Jolly says that examples of it may be seen embedded in boulder clay at Links- field near Elgin, and on the crest of the hill of Roseisle. Mr Jolly adds that the boulders of this last-named variety of Conglomerate seem to have been transported at an earlier period than those of the liver-coloured variety being generally embedded in boulder clay or drift whilst the boulders of the liver-coloured variety lie more on the surface of the country It is some core coloration of this view that there are two sets of strike on the rocks viz from 6° S. of West, and 15° N. of West. The Con- glomerate boulders from the Loch Ness Hills may have come in the first-named direction the other set of boulders across the Moray Firth, from Ross-shire (Sixth Report, pa 48). FIFESHIRE.

The N.W. end more pointed than east end also well rounded and polished by friction Boulder tolerably flat on upper side but no strike visible On each of the two sides meeting at N.W. end boulder not only smoothed but striated—chiefly along side facing N.N. W, " The nearest rocks of same composition as boulder are in Garlton Hill, about 6 miles distant and bearing W. by N. by compass If agent which smoothed and striated the sides of the boulder came as is probable from the westward it seems when it reached the boulder at A C its west end to have divided into two streams   one A B, flowing along north side E.N.E., theother C D, along the south side S.8.E. | The clay in which the boulder was buried contained blocks and pebbles some of them soft such as shale coal &c., from the west and others hard rock or greenstone granite &c.), quite capable of smoothing and starting the boulder if driven and squeezed against it by some agent of sufficient weight and magnitude (2) In the village of Linton, several portions of porphyritic rock recently exposed which are smoothed and striated On one portion of rock the surface of which is horizontal the direction of strike is W.N.W. and E.S.E. of Edvnburgh, Session 1883-84. 803 On another portion the surface of which slopes down towards north at an angle of about 35°, the direction of the strike is due E. and W. | . Each set of strike might be produced by the same agent If its normal direction was W.N.'W., it would on striking the rock which slopes down north be deflected into an E. and W. direction (3) A still more remarkable case of the same kind occurs in a cutting of the North British Railway, about half a mile to the west of Linton station The rock is on the south side of the line The smoothed surface is about 18 feet high and 25 feet in   length The surface there slopes down northwards at an angle of from N, 11° W, to N. 20° W. The strip run across the rocky surface in a direction E. 15° N.—the deflection from the normal direction of the starting agent being greater here than at Linton village on account of the larger area of the opposing surface It may be added that whilst in the lower part of the rocky sure face the strike are horizontal near the top of the rock they rise up towards the east at an angle of 4° or 5°. If the starting agent consisted of a mass of drift the pebbles and blocks in the lower part would move horizontally and produce horizontal strike But 804 Proceedings of the Royal Society in the upper part of the mass blocks and pebbles would not have the same weight above them to keep them down and in consequence of severe lateral pressure they would have a tendency to rise North Berwick Law.—(1) An account was given by Mr David Stevenson, C.E., regarding striations on the rock of this hill In his paper read to Edinburgh Royal Society, est February 1875 vole viii pa 481), he states that the west side of the Law consists of exposed rock the east side being covered by gravel clay and stones On a steeply inclined part of the hill there is a surface of the rock consisting of felspar porphyry on which he found smoothing forming a sheet of about 200 feet in length with occasional deep strike or scoring on it. He says—*“ The grooving of the surface is very distinctly marked and must have been done by the passage of some dense but yielding body which could be moulded to the different irregularities both vertical and horizontal on the surface of the hill The strike must have been made by the passage of sharp-pointed bodies harder than the felspar porphyry of the Law.” “ As viewed from a little distance the scoring appear to be nearly parallel and horizontal ; but on examining such as can be reached I found on using the clinometer, that this is by no means the case On one patch of rock I found two strike within 18 inches of each other the upper of which had a dip of 4°, and the lower a dip of 20°, and both markings were dipping towards the west being the directions from whence the movement came as indicated by the fail on the eastern side of the Law. This rise in the direction of motion may have been caused by local pressure due to the obstruction offered to the passage of the mass by the Law.” Mr Stevenson adds that the rock surface discovered by him had been entirely concealed by debris till it was removed to allow of the rock being quarried A similar mass of debris extends along the whole northern and southern faces of the hill and if removed I have no doubt similar markings would be found along both sides (2) The Convener of the Committee, thinking that North Berwick Law deserved a farther examination proceeded to it, and gave the results of his examination in a paper read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh on ith July 1879 vole xu pa 261). of Hdinburgh, Session 1883-84. 805 He found that the rock surface described by Mr Stevenson is situated on the N.W. side of the Law, and that the smoothed part slopes down towards the N. and N.W., at an angle of from 65° to 70°. Parts of the smoothed surface face N.W., other parts face due north and some N. by E.; but wherever the rock faced a more easterly direction there was no smoothing The only parts of the smoothed rock surface signaled were those fronting N.W. by N., or a few degrees on either side of that point Their direction is W. by S., or W.S.W.; and most of them are apparently horizontal - Some of the ruts and street especially at their west ends are deeply incised in the rock showing the extreme and continuous pressure which predominated there | The particular direction in which the starting agent moved may be inferred by considering that if it came in a direction parallel   with the rock surface it might grind or smooth but would hardly introduce ruts or strike nor would it have this effect if it came against the rock surface at right angles A line parallel with the rock surface would be S.W., and a line at right angles would be about N.N.W. The intermediate point would be W.N.W. from which direction therefore the Convener inferred the starting agent moved on and against North Berwick Law. 806 Proceedings of the Royal Society In the Convener’s paper a diagram was given as shown by the foregoing woodcut of a well-marked portion of the rock where it slopes down towards N. 10° W. The striations are very distinct running horizontally towards E. 22° N, But where the rock surface slopes down N. 23° E., which it does towards the east there are no strike and the rock is only smoothed (3) On the farm of Kingston, 2 miles south of North Berwick, the Convener found a small holder of red granite (4) A very large boulder of basalt stands on the beach near Tantallan Castle, which could have come only from the westward HEBRIDES. 1. Islay.—(1) Near Port Askaig, on Lossit IFarm, four or five boulders of large size One of these 13 x 8 x 8 feet a composite rock extremely hard containing crystals of quartz audited and hornblende ; boulder resting on bed of bright yellow clay rocks of district a slay schist Height above sea 300 feet (2) On Arnahoo Farm, 3 miles N. of Port Askaig and 228 feet above sea porphyry boulder stands on summit of hill in a precarious position ply will fig in Fourth Report, pa 17) (Lithograph No. 14, Plate VIIL). This boulder must have come from a direction N. by E, as explained in Report. Mull isin that direction Boulder is of hard porphyry quite different from rock of hill (3) On Persibus Farm, about 3 miles S W of Port Askaig, four or five boulders well rounded ; all a hard porphyritic rock differing from any Islay rock Their height above sea 228 feet Towards N, by E. an opening among hills through which these boulders might have been carried on floating ice (4) On a hill 2 miles north of Persibus, a boulder 18 x six 1 feet differing from adjoining rocks Height above sea 410 feet An igneous rock (5) On south of turnpike road between Bridgend and Port Helen, a large boulder lying at north base of a hill which probably intercepted it in its progress towards the south (5) On west coast in Kilchrenan parish below old parish church several boulders which apparently came from N.W of Edwnburgh, Session 1883-84. 807 2. Colonsay.—Notes sent to Committee by Mr Murray of 167 West George Street, Glasgow, and Mr Donald M‘Neill, farmer in Colonsay, long resident in the island The following points are taken from these notes :— (1) By Mr Murray.—Shores on west side of island thickly strewn with boulders many resembling yellow Mull granite A large boulder on west shore called * Fingal's Putting Stone.” At Kiloran, on N.W. part of island there are many boulders On several ridges sloping down towards west boulders occur some above a ton in weight (Seventh Report, pa 21). On west coast there are some granite blocks of a yellowish-red colour different from any rocks seen in Colonsay. In Oronsay Island there are blocks of syenite which probably may have come from Kiloran Bay in Colonsay, distant 9 miles N.N.W,, also grey granite which may have come from Colonsay. There are fragments of red granite with large crystals;—but no rocks of that variety known in Oronsay or Colonsay. On east side of Oronsay, boulder of coarse-grained granite pinky in colour which is supposed to have come from east coast of Colonsay, There are boulders of quartzite and nodules of chocolate red sand stone—but which cannot be referred to any rocks on either Colonsay or Oronsay (Nunth Report, pa 17). | 3. Mull.—On road to Torloisk from Tobermory, Professor Duns found numerous granite boulders—for most part the reddish variety—others are grey The largest boulder seen was gneiss A small quartzite boulder was also seen All of them are rounded and smooth Four boulders lie en {rainée, the line being N. and S. In approaching west coast of North Mull, boulders decrease in number The contrast is most striking as the boulders are very numerous towards east coast ‘ Has ice moving from the N.W,, begun to drop its entangled boulders near the west coast and the rate of deposit increased as it passed over the tract between Runa- Gal and Mishnish and the S.E. of Glen Frisa? Be this as it may there is no doubt as to the numerical increase of the boulders in this direction They are all much rounded Ascended Spyon More, 2435 feet above sea-level. Found a good many boulders scattered over the hill—all, so far as could be ascertained granites—no granite rock occurring in situ in this part 808 Proceedings of the Royal Society of Mull. “One of the boulders lies on the very top of Spyon More. Another is met with halfway down the hill The rocks at the summit are well emaciated ; and a great heap of moraine-like debris rests on it ” (NVinth Report, pa 27). 4. Iona.—On east coast of island a granite boulder 24 x 18 x 6 feet weighing about 190 tons Longer axis N.W. There are many boulders on E.S.E. side of island opposite to Ross of Mull, which have led some persons o suggest that these may have been transported across the narrow arm of the sea which divides Mull from Tona. But the Duke of Argyll is quoted as thinking that the Tona granite boulders are a different variety (First Report, pa 27). In Ross of Mull two varieties of granite red and grey extensively quarried (Second Report, pa 157). About half a mile north of the large boulder above specified there is another large red granite boulder about 12 feet square Hast end rests on clay slate rocks of Iona. There is a groove which was seen by Convener) on under surface of boulder running N.E., indicating that it had been pushed in or from that direction (Second Report, pa 157). To N.E. of Cathedral, along the shore hundreds of granite boulders chiefly the red variety several exceeding 20 tons The rocks of Tona are chiefly clay slate Convener saw no other and he was told there are no granite rocks “ At the south end of the island many granite boulders mostly red but some also of grey variety lying on high ground from 200 to 300 feet above sea Omne of these seen by Convener, standing upon end leaning against a rock on its S.W. side as if it had come ~ from a N.E. direction (Lithograph No. 15, Plate VIIL). Most of the boulders in south end of Iona lie with longer axis N.E. and E.N.E. | Convener heard of a large boulder on west side of island in two fragments which to his informant had suggested the idea of the boulder having been broken by falling from a height (Second Report, pa 155). | | The highest hill on island is called “ Dun I” On the N.N.W. side of this hill there is a plateau at height of 230 feet above sea On the plateau where it joins the hill there is a large red granite boulder weighing about 400 tons cubical in shape and Very | of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84. 809 angular 22 x 16 x 16 feet its base resting on the plateau and its top leaning against side of hill (Zethograph No. 16, Plate IX.). On ascending to summit of hill which reaches to height of 400 feet above sea Convener found several boulders of red granite Mr Allan M‘Donald schoolmaster doubts the theory that the red granite boulders on ‘“ Dun I” Hill came from the Ross of Mull ; first because the rocks at Ross of Mull do not reach to so high a level as 400 feet ; second because as regards the 400 ton boulder “Dun I” Hill is situated between it and the Ross of Mull, so that transportation from Ross is hardly conceivable Ross of Mull bears from boulder S.S.E. ~ The smooth faces of the rocks in Iona, front N. by E., the rough faces front south (Second Report, pa 156). In a subsequent year (1878) the Convener again visited Iona, and went to look at the large boulder on “ Dun I.” He then observed that the boulder was composed of coarse-grained red granite—more coarse than the boulders on east side of island previously referred to. The prevailing rocks of Iona are a fine-grained gneiss approach ing in many places to clay slate The boulder on “ Dun I” Hill seemed to indicate that it had been brought by some agent from a northwesterly point which agent had stranded on the hill and stuck there till boulder dropped from it. Captain Stewart of Coll was with Convener when latter examined the boulder On examining the portions broken off as also another small boulder lying below exactly similar in composition Captain Stewart at once exclaimed This is Coll granite In reference to this suggestion it is to some extent confirmed by the fact that the island of Coll bears about N.IN.W. from Iona, and is distant about 20 miles But the Convener, having visited Coll a few days afterwards, did not fall in with any granite rocks there They were all gneiss with only occasional veins of granite But he did find granite boulders in Coll, somewhat similar in composition to the large boulder on “Dun I” (Z#ifth Report, pa 4). A well rounded boulder of Conglomerate was found by Convener on east coast of Iona. Heard that similar blocks occur on west shore in St Columba’s Bay. There are no Conglomerate rocks in Iona. The nearest spot is said to be Inch Kenneth Island on west of Mull), where according to Macculloch, it forms cliffs about 100 feet high 810 Proceedings of the Royal Society (Western Islands, vole i. pa 515). Inch Kenneth is about 10 miles N.E. from Iona (Second Report, pa 155). 5. Stajfa was visited by Convener. He found on it, at his first visit several small boulders of red granite There are no rocks of granite on theisland. It consistsentirely of blue trap (Second Report,p. 157). | In a small bay on east side of island the Convener on his second visit found several small boulders of red granite gneiss quartzite and limestone none of which occur in Staffa as rocks About 20 yards from this bay Convener found an old sea-beach 36 feet above high water mark from the gradual breaking up of which the foregoing boulders are probably derived Quotation given from Dr Macculloch to show how perplexed he was to account for the occurrence on Staffa of ¢ transported stones which he assumes must have been carried by natural agency from some of the neighbouring islands (#%fth Report, pa 11). 6. Tiree.—(1) Haynish Hill, in S.W. end of island reaches to 600 feet above sea It consists of gneiss in some parts passing into granite The hill on its west side coincides with sea-cliffs, and has on it a number of rocky knoll Almost every knoll has units N. W, side (i.e., facing the Atlantic) boulders more or less rounded The following are particulars of some :— Boulder 11 x 8 x 5 feet resting on side of knoll facing W.N. W, Boulder 9 x 4 x i feet resting on side of knoll facing W. by N, at height of 360 feet above sea which is a quarter of a mile distant with access from the sea between S. and N.N.W, points This boulder is a coarse granite,—the knoll is gneiss Boulder 8 x 7 x 5 feet resting on side of knoll facing N.W. by N. at height of 365 feet above sea Sea half a mile distant and access from it open at any point between S.W. and due north Two clusters of large boulders met with the uppermost on the cluster so posed as to show it must have come from westward The sea is within half a mile to westward On this Haynish Hill boulders more numerous on sides or slopes facing W, and N.W, than on any other On slopes facing E. and S.E. there are also boulders but fewer in number (2) Passing due north along Big Cornish Road, Convener found on east side of road several rocky knoll tops of which are from 80 to of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84. 811 110 feet above sea Most of these knoll present bare rock on west sides and have boulders on those sides On one of the knoll a boulder 10 x 6 x 6 feet very near its top light coloured gneiss Rock of knoll also gneiss but dark coloured Another rocky knoll about a mile to N.E. of last has on it a number of large boulders called *“ The Giant’s Pebbles,” in reference to a legend that they were thrown by giants from Barra, an island N.W. of Tiree, and distant about 40 miles ~There are here from twenty to thirty boulders of all sizes almost all on the knoll and none on the adjoining flat land  Suggestion offered that knoll had intercepted the raft which carried the boulders (3) Ben Qott Hill forms a rocky ridge running N. and S. about 120 to 130 feet above sea A very large number of boulders chiefly on its N.W, flanks Some are on S.E. flanks possibly pushed over ridge On flat ground S.E. of ridge boulders are few in number (4) Great beds of sand and shingle in different parts of island showing that sea had prevailed over it at a comparatively recent period to a height exceeding 40 feet above present sea-level. 7. Coll.—Visited Bein Hoch; hill on west side of island reaching to 290 feet above sea There are two boulders at top one near the summit which slopes down towards N.W., the other on a flat which forms summit of hill (ZLitkograpk No. 17, Plate I1X.). Near foot of hill on its N.W. side there is a rocky plateau abutting against it, at a height of 80 feet above sea On this low hill there is a large boulder 16 x 20 x 13 feet (308 tons All these boulders are a coarse granite passing sometimes into dark coloured gneiss Rock of hill is gneiss The sea (viz., Atlantic) is towards west and north distant about half a miles There can hardly be no doubt that these boulders were brought here across the sea (2) At Grassipol an immense accumulation of boulders in a meadow which has a range of vertical rocks on its S.E. side (Zitho- graph No. 18, Plate IX.). These boulders seem to have been intern created in their farther progress by the rocks on S.E.. Sea is about three-quarters of a mile distant to N.W. One of the boulders is 30 feet high On west side of this meadow a rocky knoll covered by boulders 812 Proceedings of the Royal Society about 18 or 20 in number—the uppermost resting on the others in such a way as to show it had come from N.W. (ZLithograph No. 19, Plate IX.). Near this knoll a vein of quartz smoothed on its edges in such a way as to show smoothing from N.W. (3) On east side of island near Arinagour, the boulders few in number and small Towards the N.W. part of island when Arniboat schoolhouse is passed boulders increase in number and size (4) At S8.'W. end of island there are many large granite boulders near Coll House. Convener measured one and found it 35 x 15 x 8 feet (312 tons It was on its S.E. end leaning on or pressing against a gneiss rock The granite boulder is of a coarse variety the fragments composing it being of large size This was probably the boulder which Captain Stewart was thinking of when he come pared the large Iona boulder to Coll granite (5) Macculloch, in his account of the Geology of Coll, refers to a block of audited which he found at a great distance from the shore and which he thought must “ be a transported block as he had seen no rock of that kind in the island He says that it probably came from Rum Island, where that rock abounds Rum is situated N. by E. from Coll, and distant about 20 miles Convener omitted to inquire for this sugite block 8. Eigg.—Mr M‘Phersoﬂ, proprietor of the island drew out for the Committee some valuable notes | One large boulder rests on the Scoor ridge,—a remarkable ridge of pitchstone porphyry which runs for about 2 miles across the island in an east and west direction It reaches at its east end to a height of 1300 feet above the seat its west end to a height of 900 to 990 feet It rises from a plateau which is about 400 feet above sea | Both north and south sides of the Scoor are precipitous almost vertical showing a cliff on the north side of 270 feet on the south side of 400 feet The boulder on this ridge is near its western extremity and on a part of the ridge which is lower than any other part viz 890 feet above sea It disclose to top of ridge and on the slope facing the north This boulder is said to be of granite or gneiss rock not existing in the island of Lidinburgh, Session 1883-84. 813 Many other boulders of the same kind are strewed over the island On N.E. part of island there is a granite boulder of a larger size than any other and is of a darker colour It is on the side of a hill sloping down towards S.W., at about 300 feet above sea Hill itself is about 900 feet above sea Mr M‘Pherson says that he has seen on the shores of Loch Alsh, to the east of Skye, rocks resembling this boulder Chips of these Eigg boulders were procured They were sub fitted to Professor Geikie. Among the chips he detected one which appeared to him to have come from the Torridon group of Old Red Sandstone, viz the coast of the mainland to the north east of Skye. | Professor Geikie, in his account of the Geology of Eigg, adverts to the finding of “ pieces of Red Sandstone of Cambrian derivation which the says make it clear that the higher grounds from which they were borne could not have lain to the S. or E. but to the N.'W, or N.” (Lond. Geol. Soc. Proc., vole xxvil. pa 309) (Ninth Report, pa 22). 9. Canna.—Convener told by an experienced contractor for build ing that he bad found on the islet of Sanda forming the south give of Canna harbour blocks of a red sandstone which he made use of for the lintels and corners of a new schoolhouse The largest was 6 x 4 x 2 feet These sandstone differ from the rock of the island which is a blue slay schist ill-adapted for building He knew that these sandstone rocks abound in Rum Island, as he had quarried them there | Macculloch noticed these red sandstone blocks on Canna, which he says differ from Canna rocks and he states that similar sandstone - rocks occur in Rum and Skye ( Western Highlands, vole i, pa 467). 10. Barra.—A very large boulder of coarse gneiss approaching to granite exists here near the base of Ben Erival, on its side sloping down to north The hill reaches to about 600 feet above sea-level. Height of boulder 28 or 26 feet its extreme length 37 to 38 feet and its width about 18 feet assuming 2 tons for one cubic yards its approximate weight would be 890 tons (Fifth Report, pa 12) (Lithograph No. 20, Plate 1X.). Conveneér prevailed on tenant of the hill to dig under the boulder to discover the nature of the materials forming its site An account 814 Proceedings of the Royal Society is given on pa 67 of the Report, from which it appears that the materials were gravel and earth with sea shells The boulder was evidently not lying on rock The supposition of the Convener was that when brought to its present site it fell on what was then sea-bottom. The site of the boulder is now 230 feet above sea A plan is given in the Report, to assist consideration of the question from what direction the boulder probably came to its present site the result of the Convener’s consideration being that it must have come either from the N.W. or the N.E., there being open sea only in these two directions About 100 yards to the west of the ¢ Big Boulder” there is a rocky isolated knoll about 255 feet above the sea clustered with boulders These are lying partly on rock partly on shelly gravel and chiefly on the N.W. side of the knoll On a study of the positions of the boulders on this knoll it appeared to Convener that the uppermost boulders to get into their positions must have come from N.W. point About 200 yards N.E. of ¢ Big Boulder” there is a boulder lying on a smoothed rock surface which dips due north on an angle of 20°. This boulders 5 x 4 x 2 feet It could not have obtained and retained its position unless by having beern brought from the north | About 300 yards to S.E. of “ Big Boulder” there is a boulder 8 x 6 x 3 feet at height of 228 feet above sea The boulder at its east end presses closely on rock which has prevented it moving further in an easterly direction (Lithograph No. 21, Plate IX.). On N.W. of Ben Erival, where its sides slope down steeply to the sea there are numerous boulders many of which press against the rocks of the hill in such a manner as to show that they must have come there from some point between west and north They are at various heights from 400 to 500 feet above sea which is here the Atlantic. Ben More is a hill on Eoligarry Farm. Its west end forms a sheepish sea-cliff rising to a height of 330 feet above sea Half- way up this sea-cliff there is a boulder 20 x 10 x 5 feet resting on the rocky surface which here dips W.S.W. But the rock judging by the marks on it, has been smoothed by something passing over it of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84. 815 from N.W., and the boulder is blocked at its S.E. end by a rocky portion of the hill was shown by Lithograph No. 22, Plate IX.), At Castle Bay (at south end of Barra) the hills are covered with boulders but more on their N.W. slopes than on any other Mr Campbell (Paper on * Glacial Phenomena of Hebrides”) states that he took rubbings of strike at Castle Bay, which showed that starting agent had moved from N. by W. (magnetic). He mentions that on the small island of Bernera, about 12 miles south of Barra, he got strike at a height of 720 feet above sea cross ing the strike of the rocks from N.N.W. | On hill called Scurrival, whose west side rises abruptly from sea to height of 240 feet the hard gneiss rocks show proofs of a grinding action on them from N.W. The strata are horizontal and form blocks with their longer axis lying about N.and S. The west sides of these blocks facing sea present frequent smoothing especially at their north ends whilst the south ends remain rough showing action on the blocks from N.W. | On this hill the boulders are numerous and many of them are blocked at their S.E. ends They are from 200 to 300 yards from the sea and about 100 or 150 feet above sea-level. The situations and positions of these boulders combine to show that they must have come here from a northwesterly direction On the summit of the hill which consists of well rounded and smoothed surfaces of gneiss numerous boulders lie scattered most of them on that part of the top which faces W.N. W. 11. South Uist.—Near south end there is Carshavaule Hill,on west side of which is Loch Dunkellie. On east bank of loch a gneiss rock well striated,—the strike running N.W. by N. At a little distance to S.E., on south of Carshavaule Hill, a valley through which current might have passed after starting the rock Loch Boisdale.—On east coast Kennet Hill, situated on north side of loch presents numerous examples on its west flanks of smoothed surfaces and of large boulders many of them abut ting on rocks at their east ends see Diagrams in Fz:ftk Report, pa 17). Ome of these boulders is six 13 x 8 feet 146 tons (Lithograph No. 23, Plate 1X.). At junction of roads from Barra and Loch Boisdale, where Roman Catholic and Free Churches are situated there is a cluster of 816 Proceedings of the Royal Society boulders Omne 16 x 6 x 5 feet leaning on the others must have come from N.W. to attain its position On hill to east of Askernish, and on Mingary Hill, there are many large boulders chiefly on west flanks as also striated rocks well deserving of study (Lithograph No. 24, Plate IX.). About 3 miles to north of Askernish there is a block of granite perched on the pointed summit of a rocky hill The boulder is 14 x 12 x 8 feet about 100 tons (Lithograph No. 25, Plate IX.). There is no way in which it could have attained its position except by floating ice At Jocdar, 11 miles south of ferry between Uist and Benbecula, there are smoothed rocks *Zterally covered by parallel tried ruts and grooves the direction of which is N.W, by W. The smoothed surface of the rocks here slopes down to westward at an angle of about 10° or 12°. Some of the ruts are 4 or 5 feet long One at its N.W. end measures 8 inches across and 2 inches in depth ; another 12 inches across and 1% inch deep Towards the S.E. they lessen in width and depth There can be no doubt that the starting agent here came from N,W. The height of this place is about 25 feet above the seattle Atlantic—and % of a mile distant There is a similar good example of striated rocks about half a mile tothe west of the aforementioned ferry (Lithograph No. 26, Plate X.). On road between Grogary (mansion-house of Lady Gordon Cathcart) and Loch Skiport on east coast there are many striking examples of striated rocks and boulders Loch Eport is a remarkably narrow area of the sea on the east coast which runs more than halfway across North Uist. From deck of steamboat Convener saw on both sides of ILoch, many boulders resting chiefly on rocky knoll and many rocks with faces smoothed on west sides | North Uist.—Loch Maddy, a scalloch on east coast An hours walk for about a mile from the shore showed Convener that rocks here have their smoothest sides facing N.W. (Fifth Report, pa 22). Professor Heddle, in a subsequent years visited Loch Maddy, and reported that rocks there generally showed smoothing by some agent passing over them from the westward He refers also to two islets of trap rock called Maddy More and Maddy Beg, which are was he says ¢ porpoise-nosed to the west and of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84. 817 cliffs to the east as indicating probably the direction of the agent which flowed over them Professor Heddle on this occasion at Loch Maddy, met a gentleman a member of the Glasgow Geological Society, who had ~ just returned from Newton on the coast of North Uist. He described to the Professor a boulder he had seen there 13 xu x 4 feet and another 9 x 5 xu feet The former lay with its longer axis N.N. W, He stated also that the rocks on the west shore were generally glaciated, and from points between N.W. and S.W. (Sizth Report, pa 34). On Canneum, a rocky islet north of Loch Maddy, there are two boulders of Laurentian gneiss weighing the one about 15, the other about 50, tons From the corresponding slopes of the two ends which face each other it has been inferred that they were originally one boulder though now about 100 feet apart from one another and with a projecting rocky knoll between them The reporter Alex. Carmichael, suggested that the boulder may have fallen from a height on this rock and been broken into two frag ments (First Report, pa 35). Harris~—(1) At Rodil south end of Harris), rocks on Stron- davelhill smooth on west faces rough on east faces (2) At Borve, on west coast a remarkable assemblage of boulders on hill about 800 feet high sloping down to W. by N., close to shore of the Atlantic (Zithograph No. 27, Plate IX.).. The boulders lie on and against benches of gneiss rocks these rocks also being smoothed and ground down from westward These boulders lie in such a way as to show they have come from westward (Zifth Report, pa 23). (3) Similar appearances in Lock Castle Bay and Valley. | (4) About 1} mile south of Tarbert, several large boulders which probably reached their positions by coming through depressions existing in the range of hills to N. W, (6) On hills north of Tarbert, up to height of 800 feet above sea level Convener saw many evidences of a N.W. current loaded with ice which has brought boulders and smoothed the rocks (Fifth Report, pa 26, plate vile fig 28). Professor Heddle separately visited Tarbert, and specifies certain hornblende boulders which he traced to a rock identical in character a few hundred yards to westward (Sizth Report, pa 35). 818 Proceedings of the Royal Society (6) At Fincastle, on shore west of Loch Tarbert, Convener found boulder so situated-as to indicate transport from N.W. (7) Scalpa Island.—Three granite boulders found by Professor Heddle (Lithograph No. 28, Plate IX.), one of them * butted up against a knoll of gneiss rock see plate xvii fig 6, in Sixth Report, and pa 35). On faces of hill on Harris shore opposite Scalpa, a great bed of granite from which Scalpa boulders probably came (8) Shzant Islands.—On western shores Professor Heddle found several blocks of rocks foreign to the islands and occurring in sit in the Long Island to the west Some Conglomerate boulders he considered had come from Stornoway, 30 miles to north the nearest place for Conglomerate rocks (Szxtl Report, pa 36). Boulders of trap on eastern shores of the islands supposed to have been pushed from rocks on west side of the islands (Transactions of Norfolle and Norwich Naturalists' Society, vole iil., with Jan. 1880). 12. Lewis.—Professor Heddle examined the district between Tarbert in Harris and Stornoway on foot a distance of 28 miles He was struck with the general flatness of the district especially in its northern part considering that the rocks there come generally to the surface and are on edge They suggested the idea of some great abrade ing agent which had passed over the district (Eighth Report, pa 29). (1) Near Ardvourlie, on Loch Seaforth, a fringe of boulders forming a line K. by N. and W, by 8., apparently traceable to gap in chain of hills to S.W. Clusters of boulders seen there so piled on one another as to show that the topmost had come from westward (2) At and near Soval, 12 miles south of Stornoway, rocks forming cliffs smooth on sides facing west rough on sides facing east On one of these cliffs facing the west there is a boulder on edge of rocky cliff which there forms a surface sloping down towards W.N.W. at an angle of from 20° to 30°. Longer axis of boulder W.N.W. Seemed to Convener clearly to have come from west ward (Sketch in Fifth Report, plate viii fig 29). (3) Lochs Ourn and Shiel, on east coast  DBoulders seen by Con- wiener on hills adjoining positions of which all indicated transport from west (4) Uig, on west coast Rocks near road at two spots smoothed of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84. 819 and striated from W.N.W. Ruts deeper at west ends than at east ends (Fifth Report, pa 28). (5) Miavig, an arm of sea branching up from Loch Roag on west coast On top of a hill called Dramainan Voltas, 270 feet above sea there is an immense assemblage of boulders chiefly on north and west slopes (Lithograph No. 29, Plate X.) (Fifth Report, pa 29). (6) Garry-na-hineto Carlowrie. Rocks along and near road show smooth faces towards west At low levels they vary in their aspects as W.;—W. by 8.;—and even W.S.W. But at higher levels viz above 300 feet the smoothed faces are pretty uniformly towards W.N.W. (Fufth Report, pa 30). The explanation of this seemed to be that the rocks at high levels were exposed to a normal current from N.W., whilst rocks at low levels were exposed to diverging and wedding currents Convener examined particularly striated rocks described by Dr James Geikie (Zond. Geol. Journal for 1873, pa 537), who expressed an opinion that the strike had been formed by a glacier which moved across the slope of the rocks from the S.E. The Convener, after twice examining these rocks was of opinion that the strike had been formed by some agent passing from the N.W., inasmuch as indie visual strike were most deeply cut at their N.W. ends see sketches in Fifth Report, pa 30, and plate vile fig 32). Boulders seen leaning against rocks on their east sides as if thereby stopped in their progress eastwards (7) Betnn-a-Bhune, a hill about 400 feet above sea mentioned by Dr Geikie. Rocks seen by Convener smoothed and boulders so situated as to show probable movement from W.N.W. (8) Barvas Hills, 800 to 900 feet high 5 miles north of Storno- way examined by Convener, who found on them smoothed rock and boulders indicating movement from N. and N. W. | (9) In district between Barvas Hulls and seacoast to north there are long lines of scars composed chiefly of coarse gravel with boulders lying occasionally on their ridges ; these boulders in many places piled on one another and in such a way as to show transport from N. W, | | Several of these scars run for miles continuously and reach to the north coast following a direction generally N.W., with ocean signal reflections 820 Proceedings of the Royal Society When viewed from top of Barvas Hills they form a striking feature as the bright green of the grass covering them con trusts with the dark brown or black colour of the widespread muir which they traverse These scars reach to a height of from 30 to 50 feet above the adjoining flat ground At one place about 2 miles north of Barvas Hills) an scar expands and divides into a series of knoll on which many boulders now rest The highest knoll have on them the greatest number of boulders At two places the boulders form groups piled on one another They had formed was was mentioned by a shepherd hiding places in times of trouble Most of the boulders on these scars show transport from N.W., but some indicate a transport from W.S.W.; one from N.N.E, In this part of the island there are numerous lakelets, whose longer axis is generally parallel with the lines of escar,—a fact all the more remarkable as the outcrops of the gneiss rocks generally form lines in the direction of N.E, and S.W. and dipping S.E. Dr Geikie was much struck with this fact and expressed an opinion that the formation of the scars and of these platelets must be due to one and the same agency viz.,, a glacier or ice-sheet, which came across the “ Minch” from Ross-shire. : (10) Along coast from Barvas, eastward boulders of granite differing from any rocks near them and alleged by a local mason seen by Convener to be same as rocks 7 or 8 miles to westward A great monolith here 18 feet 9 inches high and with a girth of 16 feet called ¢ Clackan Treudach” or * Gathering Stone.” (11) Dalbeag Hulls, about 9 miles west of Barvas. Smoothed rocks and boulders indicating movement from westward (12) At Zolsta (12 miles N.E. of Stornoway) a boulder 18 x 5 x 4 feet and 358 feet above sea called the “Rocking Stone.” Rocked when Convener lifted it, or when he rested his weight on it, at either end of its longer axis Its central part rests on bare smooth gneiss rock Its longer axis points N.N.W. It is well surrounded by high hills but towards N. W. there is an opening in the range of hills through which boulder might have come (Fifth Report, pa 31). (13) Eye Peninsula to east of Stornoway, where rocks are Old Red Sandstone. Boulders of gneiss occur there which almost certainly must have come from Barvas Hills, situated about 7 miles to N.W. of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84. 821 (14) On Eye Peninsula a brickwork of boulder clay in which at a height of about 200 feet above sea fragments of marine shells seen by Convener, Dr Geikie mentions those and states that similar shells were found by him in a deposit stretching across the north part of the Lewis, from shore to shore (#%fth Report, pa 36). (15) With reference to the above-mentioned group of islands sometimes called the Long Island, remarks of a general character may not be inappropriate Mr J. F. Campbell formerly of Islay), author of Frost and Fire, wrote as follows to the Convener :— “In the Long Island, from Barra Head to the Butt of Lewis, the whole country is glaciated, with boulders everywhere perched on the hills Wherever the surface is newly exposed the striations and smoothing are so perfect that the marks can be copied as ¢ Brasses’ are copied In a letter from the same gentleman to Mr Alex. Carmichael of the Inland Revenue, a native of the Hebrides, the former red marks :(—*¢ Glacial strike occur upon fixed rocks in Tiree, Mingley, Barra, South and North Uist, and correspond with a direction from N.W. or thereabouts The hills are ice-worn to the very tops Transported blocks are scattered over all these islands 13. Skye.—The Convener regrets that the Committee received no report from this island ; nor had he an opportunity of visiting it himself except at one spot viz Loch Scavaig, on the west coast where the steamboat stops for an hour to allow passengers to see Coriusk. The Convener then saw and examined a large boulder (Lithograph No. 30, Plate X.). Its position on a rock between the sea and the adjoining lake is described on page 66, Sixth Report. The rock on which it stands slopes steeply towards W. by N., and it is in so precarious a position that it must have been very gently let down by the agent whatever it was which transported it. Professor Heddle reported that in the year 1879 he walked along N.E. part of Skye from Aird Point to Portree, and partially among the hills but saw no boulders He visited Stainchol Island, situated off the east coast and found Cambrian Conglomerate blocks similar to what he had seen on the Shiant Islands, and similar also to the rocks existing in the Lewis, 822 Proceedings of the Royal Society near Stornoway. On Stainchol shore the Professor found tolerate boulder containing Labradorite. He states that the parent rock is situated about fifty yards to N.N.W. (Sixth Report, pa 38). Judging from what is casually said by Dr Macculloch and Principal James Forbes, regarding boulders in Skye, they must be numerous and interesting Thus Forbes refers to boulders * poised upon others or fantastically balanced on the tops of elliptical domes of rocks,;” and Macculloch says that the summits on which some of the boulders stand are not only bare but often very narrow while their declivities are steep and sometimes perpendicular Macculloch confesses his inability to explain these phenomenal INVERNESS-SHIRE. Loch Nevis, on west coast Several large boulders of coarse grained granite seen near Inverie House, lying on slate rocks On road towards Gussern, several boulders of interest pointed out to Convener by late Mr James Baird, the proprietor | At height of 360 feet above sea and near seashore rocks smoothed and striated from N.W. by W. Two large boulders lie on side of a hill which slopes down to the W.N.W. One of these of elongated shape has its longer axis N.W. and S.E. A large boulder consisting of two fragments pointed out by Mr Baird, in consequence of his believing that the boulder had been broken by falling from a height and striking on the bare rock where these fragments now lie The two fragments are four or five feet apart Whilst the opposing surfaces correspond in shape they are so weathered as to show that the fracture was not of recent date At summit level between Inverie and Gussern, there is a horizontal terrace facing the sea and at from 400 to 500 feet above sea with a number of boulders on 1t. At Invergussern, lower part of valley blocked by a huge gravel ridge now cut through by river quite in the position of a terminal moraine But, being composed of nearly horizontal beds of gravel and sand from 40 to 50 feet deep more probable that it is a sea deposit and that it for some time confined a lake for on the sides of valley horizontal waterline occur (Second Report, pa 164). of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84, 823 2. Lock Corry, near Morvern, has its rocky shores well glaciated. A large knoll of red granite at mouth of loch has had its W.N. W, sides rounded and partly striated up to 150 feet The S.E. side of knoll rough and craggy (Eighth Report, pa 29). On north shore there is an angular block 27 x 27 x 11 feet apparently moved 28 yards from a rocky cliff situated to N.W., of which it had been part The hills on the Glen Sanda property reach ing to a height of 1800 feet and more are emaciated to their very tops 3. On Lock Shiel, several similar cases of large blocks from 1 to 10 tons weight apparently forced from rocky cliffs and carried east wards White granite vein or dyke met with near top of hill 2718 feet above sea from outcrop of which blocks detached and carried east ward nearly one-third of a miles 4. In Glen Oban, remarkable examples of rounded rock-surfaces, some more than 100 feet high ; also of perched boulders on isolated rocky knoll each from 300 to 400 feet high and inacces- bible as shown in woodcut annexed   5. Mid Lochaber.—Memoir by Rev. Professor Duns, on Surface- Geology of and particularly on the boulders found to N. and W. of Ben Nevis. The Professor says—*‘ Granite boulders are lying on the mica schist rocks where the side of the mountain slopes down so steeply as to make it a puzzle to understand how they can remain in position 824 Proceedings of the Royal Society The author expresses belief that the phenomena may find explain ation in the recognition of two movements,—one outward from Ben Nevis as a centre the other force travelling from the W.N.' W, or NNN.W. (Fighth Report, pa 21). Notes on boulders situated to the west of Fort-William, by Mr Colin Livingston, teacher of public school Fort-William, The author enumerate boulders and striated rocks on west side of Ben Nevis, and expresses a confident opinion that two glaciers existed the one descending Glen Nevis, the other Glen Spean and Glen More. He refers to immense mounds and ridges of retrial matter having imperfect stratification towards Inverlochy and Torlundy, such as might have been produced if it fell from some height (Eighth Report, ppy 23, 27). 6. Since the time when Mr Livingstone’s Notes given in the Eighth Report) were framed he has made a further inspection of the hills to the W, and S.W. of Ben Nevis, and has communicated to Convener the following additional facts Stob Ban, reaching a height of 3274 feet above sea is situated west of Glen Nevis. It is composed of quartzite which accounts for its Gaelic name of White Pin. Boulders of this rock are found to the eastward on various parts of the west slopes of Ben Nevis. Another hill of interest is * Mulloch-Nan-Coirean,” 3077 feet having a rounded top of red granite On its top there is a slab of mica slate How it came there Mr Livingsione says is a mystery He admits that mica slate rock exists in large quantities towards Sghor Challum, a hill 1823 feet situated to the west But he sees the difficulty of conceiving that any glacier could have brought it. On the same hill there are boulders of micaceous gneiss and quartz The quartz boulders he says may have come from Stob Ban ; the birthplace of the gneiss boulders is the says uncertain 7. Notes on Ben Nevis and Craig Dhu, by Professor Heddle of St Andrews, were sent to Committee. He expresses an opinion that a glacier swept down Glen Nevis, even overlapping a hill of 3077 feet He also suggested the probable existence of another vast glacier cradled in the gorges between Aonach Beg and Aonach Mor. 8. Ben Nevis.—Convener ascended to top by a path leading up the N.W. side of hill Enormous boulders of grey granite lie on N.W. slopes A few on each side of path were measured and gave of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84. 8256 the following results:—16 x 10 x 10 feet (118 tons partially sunk in gravel 15 x 7 x 5 feet lying on bare rock 13 x 7 x 4 feet one nearly cubical the sides being each about 4 feet square The first three have longer axis N.W. They are from 900 to 1200 feet above sea DBut there are some up to 2000 feet above sea Mr Doig, builders Fort-William, who accompanied Convener, mentioned that there had been one boulder at the foot of mountain on its N.'W. side so large as to afford materials for building the entire front wall of the Town Hospital of Fort-William, Mr Doig stated that he considered that the boulders on west flank of the mountain were generally different from Ben Nevis rocks (L7fth Report, pa 65). 9. On Treshlik Hill, 1566 above sea on north side of Linnhe Loch opposite to Fort-William), Convener, under guidance of M Livingstone, inspected a coarse-grained granite block 8 feet high 52 feet below summit on west slope of hill This hill forms a ridge about half a mile long running W.S.W. Rocks in situ are clay slate DBoulder must have been transported from some westerly point and put down very gently as slope exceedingly steep where boulder rests (ZLethograph No. 31, Plate X.) (Second Report, pa 161). | Rocks on north and west sides of hill near top are well smoothed ; rocks on S. E. side of hill are rough The smoothed rocks are chiefly on a space along north side of hill from 30 to 60 feet below summit Many coarse-grained granite blocks and waterwort pebbles lie along north face of hill near the top 10. Boleskien, Abertarff, and Dores.—Well rounded granite boulders of red and grey varieties occur over district of Strath- derrick One above ground measured 20 x 10 x 7 feet and there seemed to be as much below TIts longer axis N. and S, Another at Fall of Foyers measured above ground 12 x 6 x 6 feet Several are poised on tops of isolated hills Highest hills in this district about 2900 feet above sea Boulders are chiefly above the level of 2350 feet Below this level they are generally of a smaller size Reported by Captain White, R.E. (Second Report, pa 137). 11. Lochaber.—In this district one of the most interesting hills is Glen Dhu 2200 feet between Glen Roy and Glen Spean. Pro- lessor Heddle, having visited it, expressed an opinion that the large 826 Proceedings of the Royal Society boulders on and near the top had come from a S.S.E. direction (Eighth Report, pa 37). As other geologists have visited this hill and recorded views which contain further information it is right to refer to them Thus Mr Jamieson of Ellon mentions having seen several large boulders of sienitic granite on or near the top of Craig Dhu, a gneiss hill at a height of 2100 feet above sea He says What is remarkable is that the largest and most angular are more numerous high up on the very brow of the hill than further down Thus” the says “* one 12 x 9 x 6 feet lay only 130 feet below the summit ; another was a magnificent block 15 xbox 6 feet (L. G. S: J., vole xvii pa 175). The late Professor Nicol of Aberdeen, well known as a geology gist refers to the Craig Dhu boulders in these terms :— “ T found huge blocks of black granite and smaller masses of red porphyry within a few yards of the summit of Craig Dhu, a conical mountain of mica slate One block must weigh 40 tons They are evidently ice-borne, probably floated from the N.W.” (Lond Geol. Soc. Proc., August 1869, pa 283). The Convener visited Craig Dhu, and noted the following points :—(1) The boulders on the hill in so far as not of a round shape have their longer axis K. and W. A little above 1391 feet level found boulder on bare rock which here forms a flat surface emaciated like the rest from W.by N. The boulder must have come after glaciation of rocks Looking towards west saw a line in that direction clearing all the hills showing an opening for a move ment from west towards and upon Craig Dhu. Masses of white quartz rock were found emaciated from west A boulder near top of the hill with longer axis W. by S. (Edm Roy. Soc. Trans., vole xxvilL pa 641). Mr Jamieson refers to a granite boulder on the fop of Bohun- tine a hill 2000 feet high not far from Craig Dhu (Eighth Report, pa 639.) Mr Jamieson, in describing smoothing and scoring of the rocks at ZLoch Treirg, up to 1280 feet states that he found “ perched boulders and rounded surfaces of rock much higher and even up to the top about 3155 feet above the sea The gneiss though it runs in nearly vertical stratification is neverthe- of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84. 827 less so free from any loose fragments on its surface and the ends of the strata are often so rounded in outline as to raise a suspicion that some deluding agent had flowed over it, at a period geologic cally recent (Lond. Geol. Soc. Proc., vole xviii pa 172). The following cases of boulders were reported by the Convener :— On the summit of the hills at the head of Glern Roy (1320 feet above the sea there are enormous granite boulders “ Some rest on bare rock but traces of clay and gravel in their vicinity suggest that they may originally have been embedded in drift which has been since mostly washed away from under and about them ” (Edin. Roy. Soc. Trans., vole xxvil. pa 639). The late Charles Darwin, who visited Lochaber, and wrote an instructive memoir on the ¢ Parallel Roads” question refers to the Ben Erin hills,—their height reaching to 1600 feet above the sea He says that on the mountains between Glen Roy and Glen Glouy, on a hillock N.N.W. of the summit of Ben Erin, I found several masses of granite one of which was 4 x 3 x 2 feet resting on the surface of the gneiss This hillock seemed to be entirely come posed of the latter rock and it was separated from all other hills by a valley On the flanks of Ben Erin, at about the same level there were several boulders of granite.”—‘ With respect to these Ben Erin boulders they are completely cut off from every granite district by valleys the Zighest point of which is 920 feet below a boulder the altitude of which I measured that is it would be impossible to walk from granite in situ to these boulders without ascending at least that number of feet (Darwin, “ On the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy,” Phil. Trans. of Roy. Soc. of London, for 1839, page 69). Sir John Ramsden of Ardverikie on Loch Laggan) informed Convener that on the top of two contiguous hills forming part of his estate east of Loch Laggan one of these hills exceeding 3000 feet in height there are large granite boulders Sir John Ramsden guided the Convener to the Wester Beinin Hill situated on the west side of Loch Laggan) to see several grey granite boulders The rocks of the hill are red granite One of the boulders is on a shelf about 1516 feet above the sea on the side of a hill sloping down to W.S. W, Facts bearing on the direction of boulder transport in Loch- aver have been noticed by several geologists Thus, Mr Jamieson mentions that on the hill ride between Glen Siean and Glen   828 Proceedings of the Royal Society Gluoy the direction of the strip at a height of 800 or 900 feet above the sea is from W. 20° N. to W. 40° N.; and as the western sides of the rocks were most worn the action had come from that side (Lond. Geol. Soc. Journ., just January 1863, pa 246). In Glen Roy (at about 1200 feet above the sea he found much to his surprise that nice had come from the S.W. up the glen and had gone out in a wide stream towards the wide valley of the Spey,” viz eastward | | ‘11, Black Mount district near Rannoch.—Boulders of a peculiar white granite found by Professor Heddle, forming a ¢rainée. He investigated from what hills they came and traced them to™lban- nach Hill, reaching to a height of 3425 feet above the sea and situated about 10 miles N.W, from Loch Tulla, Reference is made by the Professor to an enormous boulder weighing about 1900 tons in a narrow part of a valley at Loch Dochart, where traces were seen of some very powerful agent which had passed through the valley eastward 12. In the Fourth Boulder Report up 14) an account is given of the Fassnacloich boulders a species of black granite Specimens were sent to Mr Judd of London, on account of his personal know ledge of rocks in the West Highlands. His opinion was that the rock of the boulder was identical with rocks in Mull and Ardna- merchant from which district therefore he supposed the boulders may probably have been transported On the shore of the Linnhe Loch, af Appin, there are two huge well-rounded boulders of the same kind of granite Their position favours Mr Judd’s suggestion that all these boulders had been transported from the westward The granite boulders on the top of Craig Dhu, already men tinned in Lochaber, are of a dark colour Is it possible that the mountains of Mull and Ardnamurchan eould have supplied all these boulders when the sea stood 2000 feet or more above its present level ? (Fourth Report, pa 45). 124, Ardgour district on north side of Linnhe Loch.—Professor Heddle of St Andrews, in Seventh Report, pa 36, states that on Stob Choire a Chearchazll he found a trainee of boulders lying along the ridge for nearly a miles at heights varying from 2400 to 1800 feet above the sea The direction of the trainee was N.N.W.,   of Edunburgh, Session 1883-84. 829 and green hornblende - Thinking that these boulders might also be found on the south side of the Linnhe Loch, he crossed and on two hills there viz Bein Bhan, at a height of 1500 feet and on Beinn na Gueaig, at a height of 2017 feet he found boulders of the same syenite as he had found on the north side of the loch In the Eighth Report up 33) Professor Heddle mentions his dish cover of more boulders of the same peculiar syenite as seen by him on hills nearer Ben Nevis and on Ben Nevis itself at an altitude of 2200 feet This discovery led him to change his opinion as to the direction of the transport of these boulders | 13. Loch Creran.—The boulders there were examined by Professor Heddle. He was much puzzled to explain from what district they came There were strip on the rocks of the hills adjoining at heights exceeding 2000 feet above the sea He was inclined to think that the boulders had crossed the Linnhe Loch from Loch Sunart and Glen Tarbert. | On some of the hills of this district boulders were discovered at heights exceeding 2000 feet which Professor Heddle was satish fied must have crossed valleys to reach their positions and by means of floating ice (Sixth Report, pa 43). 14. Glencoe District.—On the western slopes of a hill in the higher part of ‘Glencoe, near Loch Tulla, boulders of a peculiar white granite were found by Professor Heddle, They were different from the adjoining rocks He already knew that the rocks in the hills to the eastward were also different so in expectation of finding the parent rocks a search towards the west was commenced On reaching the Aonach-Eagachk range of hills the same kind of boulders were seen fewer in number but larger in size They were lying chiefly on the eastern side of the narrow ridge leading up to the summit of the nameless peak marked 2938 feet on the Ordnance map On the next rounded haunch (2880 feet they were not seen but they reappeared on the ridge as it ascended to the eastern peak of Meal Dearg (3090 feet and almost up to the summit of the western peak (3118 feet “Their position adds Professor Heddle, was most peculiar They lay on a ridge not many times wider than their own bulk and only on the eastern slopes of that ridge while on the lower hills where they were first seen the same boulder lay on the west slopes (Siath Report, pa 44). “It is a fact of con i       830 Proceedings of the Royal Society boulders on Aonach-Eagach occupy positions much higher in level than any of the kills in a very wide extent of country so that it is difficult if not impossible to adopt for them the explanation of any local glacier (Sixth Report, pa 46). In the following years Professor Heddle returned to the Rannoch district to search for any farther traces of this stream of white granite boulders To the S.E. of Loch Rannoch he found two hills Gea Charn and Creag Mhor (2595 and 2250 feet forming a sort of ridge running nearly N. and S., and so situated as to cross what might have been the line of stream Two boulders found each weighing about 7 tons very similar in colour and composition to Loch Tulla boulders He next proceeded to Schehallion, situated about 3 miles farther east and found on its western slope about 140 feet below the summit z.e., 3407 feet above the sea a boulder of the Loch Tulla group about three-quarters of a ton in weight Reference is made to other geologists who had previously found boulders on Schehallion, near its top—one being Robert Chambers, who concluded from the striations on the rocks of Schehallion, that the stream which brought the boulders had flowed from W. 30° N, (Seventh Boulder Report, pa 34). Convener passed through Glencoe Valley thrice the last time on foot beginning near the upper end He was impressed with the belief from what he saw that ice had passed down the glen smoothing the rocks along bottom and so far up each of the sides and carrying blocks of these rocks for some distance down the valley On the other hands it appeared to him that blocks of rocks foreign to the valley had come up the valley at a subsequent period,—brought therefore by the action of floating ice One of these a huge mass of Conglomerate, was resting on a terrace of gravel ; and above the gravel there were on the hillsides adjoining extensive beds of sand reaching to heights exceeding 2000 feet above the sea Besides this Conglomerate boulder there were granite boulders in such positions as to show that they also had come up the glen The Con- veer concluded that the glen had first been occupied by a glacier and that at a later period the land sank to more than 2000 feet below its present level which would allow floating ice to pass over the Glencoe Hills, and to deposit on them some of the boulders they might be carrying (Fifth Report, ppy 52, 53) (Lithograph No. 33, Plate X.).

Fort Augustus.—About 2 miles to S.W, of the town on Corryarrick road a boulder of grey gneiss on a steep bank of gravel at base of a buff-coloured telepathic rock As the hill-slope faces N.W., boulder seemed to have come from that quarter It happens to be exactly at same height above Loch Ness (207 feet as boulder seen to the east of Urquhart (Fifth Report, pa 64). 17.

(Fifth Report, pa 63). At summit of hill about 1170 feet above sea numerous boulders found chiefly on slopes facing N, W. (2) On public road to Urquhart, a few miles from Affric Hotel, rocks on south side of road ground down and striated in a line about E. and W., 7.e., parallel with axis of main valley At top of hill about 660 feet above sea several boulders found resting on a bed of sandy clay and on a slope of hill facing W. by S. The west sides of boulders chiefly rounded as if worn by friction of bodies passing over them from west All the rocks exposed show smoothing on sides facing west as far up as hill reaches viz 927 feet above sea (3) Whole of Glen Urquhart indicates by quantity of gravel and sand on both sides that it has formerly been choked by drift which cut through and scoured out by the river (4) On north bank of Loch Ness, half a mile east of Urquhart, many conglomerate boulders lie on hill sloping towards Loch Ness, from 200 feet up to 800 feet above Loch Ness. Rocks of hill here are gneiss ; Mealfourvonie hill situated some miles to west consists of Conglomerate rock * Convener made this excursion accompanied by Mr Jolly (Inverness), to ascend Mawm Saul, a mountain reaching a height of 3880 above sea in order to investigate the truth of a report by Ordnance surveyors that on the west side of this mountain at a height of 3800 feet horizontal beds of sand and gravel had been seen by them After the foot of the mountain was reached 832 Proceedings of the Royal Society ‘At height of 450 feet above loch deep beds of a fine sandy clay occur One of the boulders is at a height of 340 feet above loch which corresponds with a horizontal terrace on south side of loch 18. Gllen Morriston and Glendoe, on north side of Loch Ness.— (1) In Eighth Report up 15) Professor Heddle describes several boulders on the hills at the head of Glen Morriston, near Clunie Inn, at great heights and some on very steep slopes apparently transported from westward (2) The Convener (Fourth Report, pa 23) describes a visit to Glendoe, at head of Glen Morriston, where he found several boulders of large size at heights of from 919 feet to 1205 feet above the sea These boulders rest on gravel and sand and in height correspond occasionally with horizontal terraces occurring on opposite side of the valley where they occur - In a higher part of valley viz about 1190 feet above sea deep beds of sand and gravel found Terrace seen by Ordnance surveyors at height of 1280 feet at top of glen The Convener was told of a still larger boulder about 16 feet high at Clachnaharry, on south side of Loch Clunie, 2 or 3 miles west of Glendoe. 19. (1) In Stratherrick, a large patch of grey grate rocks occurs They are extensively quarried and therefore are easily recognisable Blocks have been carried eastward even to near Elgin. They occur also on the tops of the Conglomerate hills between Loch Kecklis and Loch Ness, at heights of from 1400 to 1500 feet (Jolly, in Fifth Report, pa 72). (2) Along north bank of Loch Ness, near east end a patch of red granite occurs blocks of which have been recognised in the Tomna- zurich gravel hill near Inverness, and even on towards Nairn and Forres (Fifth Report, pa 69). Along south bank of Loch Ness, near east end a peculiar liver coloured Conglomerate rock occurs blocks from which seem identical with a number of large boulders east of Inverness (#%fth Report, pa 71, and Sexth Report, pa 47). The late George Anderson of Inverness states that in some of the drift deposits near Inverness there are pebbles and boulders ¢ that appear to have come from very distant parts of the country Such,”   of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84. 833 (Ross-shire), and the quartz rock of Foyers” (Wernerian Trams., vole ivy pa 205). Mr Jamieson of Ellon adverts to this same drift accumulation known as Tornain Hill, in the following terms :—¢ There are masses of coarse waterwort gravel rudely piled together 200 feet thick The stones are all water-rolled, and show no glacial street The pebbles are of various kinds of metamorphic and crystalline schisms red sandstone conglomerates granites and porphyries. These materials look as if derived fromthe rocks along the valley to the southwest ” (Proceedings of the London Geological Society, January 11, 1865). (3) In town of Inverness, a boulder of greenstone or black granite called “ Clack-na-Cudaine”—* Stone of the tube now standing in High Street, with pillar on it supporting town memorial bearings Stone had formerly stood at top of cliff above River Ness, and from time immemorial afforded a convenient rest for the tubs or pitchers in which the women brought up water for household used When a supply of water was brought into the town by pipes the magistrates proposed to break up the boulder but the townspeople objected at first even to its removal A compromise was come to by the boulder being shifted to the side of the street opposite to the Court-House, and by the erection on it of the Town Arms (First Report, pa 18). (4) At Clachnaharry, a boulder weighing about 100 tons called “The Watchman’s Stone,” resting on a projecting part of the coast opposite to Inverness), from which a good view can be had of Moray and Beauly Firths. Above Clachnaharry there are smoothed rocks with grooves run ning E. and W., a direction parallel with Beauly valley (5) Culloden Muir.—Here stands ¢ The Duke of Cumberland’s Stone,” a Conglomerate boulder with six sides height about 6 feet and girth not quite 60 feet Its longeraxis W.N.W.

They are chiefly on west slopes On this hill there are horizontal terraces with boulders on them At east end of Flichity valley a great embankment which before being cut through by River Nairn, must have been the means of forming a lake filling the valley The cut across this embark ment through which river flows is about 200 feet deep | There are also in the upper part of Nairn valley many large gneiss boulders supposed by Mr Jolly to have come from the west several of which are split ; one at height of 2260 feet above sea-level. At Farr, in Nairn valley to the east of the embankment and near - - .

Some rest on emaciated rock surfaces sloping down to westward and which therefore suggest transport of the boulders from westward Reasons given for suggesting first a glacier which passed down eastward and subsequently a submergence of the land under the ocean (Second Report, pa 159). (9) About 6 miles S.W. of Inverness, an extensive plain about 645 feet above sea-level, covered with drift on which several Con- glomerate boulders occur They probably came from Duntelchaig and other hills to westward One is 24 x 21 x 8 feet—340 tons Longer axis W.N.

It lies on gneiss rock and on Very edge of a precipice of 100 feet vertically below it, on its N.E. side In order to reach a site in this position it could have come in no other way than in a direction between W. by N. and W.N.W., and almost certainly on floating ice On the same hill there are other boulders of smaller size whose position in like manner suggests transport from westward (10) Some miles farther south there is a lake bearing name of ¢ Loch Clachan,” probably on account of the number of boulders on its banks and the hills adjoining Most of these are of grey granite By reference to Professor Geikie’s Geological Map of Scotland, it will be seen that the nearest position for granite rocks in this district is Loch Faraline, about 15 miles westward One of these boulders is 21 x 20 x 14 feet (218 tons at 983 feet above sea Another about same size and at about 1259 feet above sea has its sharp end towards west The east end is broad and butted up against a gneiss rock which would obstruct its passage eastward On this gneiss rock there are E. and W, strike which might have been made by the boulder pushing and pressing hard pebbles over the rock (The facts given in (9) and (10) are taken from Convener’s Treatise on Ancient Water Lines, ppy 86, 87.)

(Sitxth Report, pa 27 ; Highland Society’s Trans., vole vile pa 716, Hay Cunningham). Professor Harkness, in the year 1870, made known to the Lon- ~ don Geological Society his discovery of Criffel granite boulders in Cumberland. In his paper published in the Quarterly Journal for 838 Proceedings of the Royal Society not only in the form of blocks on the surface but also in the boulder clays The Criffel granite blocks are also common in the boulder clays of the vale of Eden. He adds that there are also ¢ Eskars in the valley which yield blocks of Criffel granite In the Ninth Report of the English Boulder Committee, an act count is given of the boulders found while excavating for the new docks at Maryport, on the south side of the Solway ; among them were granite blocks varying in size from pebbles to blocks of a tons It is remarked in the Report that * the nearest granite occurs in ‘ Kirkcudbrightshire Hills, 15 or 20 miles distant nearly due north In the Fifth Report of the English Boulder Committee (Br. Ass. Pr. for 1877, pa 82) there is notice of a Criffel granite boulder found near Liverpool in excavating for new docks It is added ¢ that Mr J. Geikie and Mr Horne pronounced specimens which were sent to them to be from the outskirts of the Criffel granite area There is ground for believing that Criffel granite boulders occur even so far south as Lancashire. Mr Mellard Reade of Liverpool, C.E. and F.L.G.S., wrote in the course of 1882 to the Convener, that having for some years while investigating the drift deposits near Liverpool, collected specimens from boulders some of which were evidently derived from rocks different from any belonging to that part of England, he wished to submit these to any person known to the Convener to be well acquainted with the rocks of the S.W. of Scotland. The Convener having suggested Mr Dudgeon of Cargen, Dumfriesshire, Mr Reade transmitted the specimens to him the result of which is explained in the following extract of a letter from Mr Reade to the Convener— “Mr Dudgeon recognises with certainty Criffel granite having assured himself of its identification by having seen in some of the specimens submitted to him the minerals sphere and allah nite which he is mot aware occur in any other gravitic district nearer than Aberdeenshire and Sutherland. He also thinks some of the granites come from veins in the Silurian rocks about 7 miles from Dumifries.” * * Mr M. Reade has since (Feb. 1884) read in the London Geological Society a paper narrating a visit he made to Kirkcudbrightshire, for the purpose of comparing chips from the Lancashire boulders with the supposed parent rocks In this paper he mentions his identification not only of granite boulders with the rocks of Criffel and Cairnsmore of Fleet, but also of Liver-       of Edinburgh, Session 18833-84. 839 LANARKSHIRE.

(2) At Brickwork, near Garscube Road, sandstone rocks also striated from N.W., and more deeply than at Possil. At this place numerous boulders of old red conglomerate grey granite schisms &c., supposed to be from Bonaw and Kilpatrick Hills to N.W. (Secornd Report, pa 165). LINLITHGOWSHIRE. 1. Bonwington District.—(1) On Pumpherston estate the ¢ Ballen- reich Boulder,” in girth 10 or 12 feet but now broken up into eight fragments It is a coarse dolerite, of which no rocks nearer than Bathgate Hills, about 2 miles to N.W. Had been about 60 tons in weight The boulder was lying on boulder clay Not far from this boulder there is another of quartzite about a quarter of a ton in weight and containing crystals of green mica most probably transported from Highlands. (2) On Tornain Hill, Bonnington Farm, occupied by Mr James Melvin, another tolerate boulder known as the * Witch’s Stone,” about same size as that at Pumpherston, and about same height above sea viz 431 feet It lies on a slope which faces W.N.W. On digging below the boulder Mr Melvin found it resting on decomp posed trap Nearest rock of same kind is on Bathgate Hills, situated i miles W.N.W. There is a valley between Tornain Hill and Bathgate Hills, across which boulder had probably been transported If a line be drawn - from this boulder to Bathgate Hills, it passes close to “ Ballengeich boulder This boulder also has been broken into six fragments Some archaeological interest attaches to boulder as on one of its frag ments there are * cup markings (3) Formerly, on S.E. side of Tornain, another tolerate boulder read he exhibited chips from these boulders and the parent rocks for come prison In this paper there is a becoming acknowledgment that Mr Mackintosh had been the first to refer the Lancashire granite boulders to 840 Proceedings of the Royal Society 21 x i x 4 feet lying with longer axis E. and W., and at height of about 300 feet above sea If it also came from Bathgate Hills it probably had to come by floating ice round Tornain Hill, by valley between Tornain Hill and the Crow Hills. (4) In channel of River Almond, below Kirkliston, a boulder of Old Red Sandstone conglomerate 51 x 41 x 4 feet ; nearest rock for which is at Callander, about 40 miles to N.W., with several valleys and ranges of hills between (5) At Ratho Railway Station, rocks smoothed and striated on west sides the direction of the strike being W.N.W.

Simpson deciphered is described by him as a massive unseen block of secondary greenstone many large boulders of which lie in the bed of the neighbouring river The block is 7 feet 3 inches in length and 12 feet in circumference (Proc. of Society of Scotch Antiquaries, vole ivy pa 122). MIDLOTHIAN OR EDINBURGHSHIRE. 1. Pentland Hills.—The late Charles Maclaren was the first who described e boulders on these hills The one of most interest is of mica slate weighing 8 or 10 tons The nearest spot from which it could have come is at or near Loch Vennacher or Loch Earn, about 80 miles to the N. W, With reference to the transport of this boulder Mr Maclaren says:—* To reach the spot where it lies it must have passed over extensive tracts of country from 500 to 600 feet lower than this spot Even were all Scotland converted into a mer de glace like Greenland, no moving mass in the shape of a glacier could carry this boulder and there are many such from its native seat in Perthshire or Argyleshire to Habbie’s Howe. An iceberg from the North or West Highlands, and floating in a sea 1500 or 2000 feet above the present level of the Atlantic, is an agent capable of effecting the transportation of the stone and offers I think the only conceivable solution of the problem (Edin. New Phil. Journal, 1846, pa 138). Referring to this boulder and to another also of mica slate on the   of Edinburgh, Sesston 1883-84. 841 Nicol remarked :—* When it is considered that these masses must have been carried upwards of 40 miles in a direct line floating ice seems the only agent to which their transportation can be ascribed (Lond. Geol. Soc. Journal, vole ve pa 23). He adds:—* Some of these Pentland Hill boulders are of kinds of rock which I have never seen in Scotland. On one hill 1500 to 1600 feet high I found these travelled stones particularly abundant and apparently increasing in number from below upwards In some places they appeared to form broad bands running nearly in straight lines from N.N.'W. to S.8.E.,~—and without any reference to the present declivity of the ground,—except becoming more numerous towards the summit of the ridge (Sixth Report, pa 26). | A number of rock surfaces occur on the Pentlands with strike Mr James Croll, of the Scotch Geological Survey, describes one of these on the very summit of Allermuir Hill, at a height of 1617 feet above the sea On examining the strike he says he had no “diffi- cult in determining that the ice which effected them came from the west On the summit of the hills we found patches of boulder clay in hollow basins of the rock Of one hundred pebbles collected from the clay every one with the exception of three or four come posed of hard quartz presented a flattened and ice-worn surface and forty-four were distinctly stratified A number of these stones must have come from the Highlands to the N.W.” (Fifth Report, pa 82). - | In like manner Professor Geikie, in his interesting Memoir on the Geology of the Neighbourhood of Edinburgh, observes that “ boulder clay lies along the N.W. flanks of the Pentlands, rising to a level of at least 1300 feet When the clay has been removed we usually find the rocks below polished grooved and scratched in a direction nearly E. and W, or E.S.E. and W.S.W. The parallelism of the striations throughout the present district shows that the floating ice must have moved in a pretty uniform direction and that it was from the west is rendered clear by the striation of the western faces of the hills by the great depth of drift on their eastern sides and by the fact that the transported boulders when traceable to their parent rock have been carried from W. to E.

Edinburgh and Suburbs.—The late Charles Maclaren, in his Geology of Fife and the Lothians, published in 1838, refers to boulders which he found on or near Arthur’s Seat, the Castle Hill, and Calton Hill. | On Arthur's Seat, about twenty or thirty boulders are specified up to 30 tons most of which he identified with rocks situated to the west of the boulders Others of sandstone he found at much higher levels than any sandstone rocks now on the adjoining hills up 64, and edition To the east of the Castle H7ll, numerous boulders are mentioned as having been found to the eastward which are with good reason referred to the Castle rock but other boulders are mentioned up 91) as having been found on the west side of the Castle rock which must be referred to some more distant locality It is right for Convener to notice a Conglomerate boulder standing on a stone pillar in the public gardens at the foot of the Castle rock It was brought there as an ornament to the gardens by Mr Henderson, nurseryman, who had been entrusted by the magistrates with the are management of the gardens He had found it in his own Nursery Gar- dense Leith Walk. Itisprobablya true erratic hailing from Callander. On the Calton Hill, boulders are mentioned by Mr Maclaren as found there of the very peculiar sienitic greenstone of Cor- etorphine Hill” up 72). In the year 1847,* a new road (at the expense of Government), was made round Arthur’s Seat, which required an excavation to be made on the S.'W. side of the hill between the main body of the hill and an outlying knoll known on account of its basaltic columns as “ Sampson’s ribs at height of 390 feet above the sea The hollow between the hill and the knoll was excavated to a depth of 20 or 30 feet in order to lessen the sleepless of the road Thereby a trough or gully with rocky sides sloping steeply towards the axis of the gully was disclosed The axis of the trough was about N.W. and S.E. ; its length about 120 yards its width at the narrowest part where the road was made about 10 yards As the rocky sides of the gully sloped down towards the * The particulars here given will be found in a paper by the Convener     of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84. 843 axis these sides would probably meet below ; but the excavation for the road did not reach that point The gully had been filled with till and contained numerous boulders,—almost all of which were found to be different from any of the rocks on Arthur’s Seat, viz felspar greenstone porphyry limestone both lacustrine and marine quartz greywacke, with fragments of shale and coal Many of these blocks were found in contact with both sides of the gully The largest blocks were near the north end The large blocks were well rounded ; the small blocks less so One large boulder on the west side of the gully appeared to have been pressed against the rock there and had stuck in that position being rounded and also partially striated on its N.E. side an indication of the friction it had undergone by materials forced through the gully from a N.W. direction The gully was not throughout of equal breadth ; at its narrowest point the sides when the boulder clay and drift were cleared away were found at one place to be about 15 feet nearer one another than elsewhere The rocks on the east side had been ground down smoothed and striated some of the strike being continuous for nearly 6 feet and % of an inch deep | Generally, the strip were horizontal but at and near the narrowest part of the gully the strike were seen to rise up at an angle of 4° or 5°;—caused probably by the obstruction to the drift when being forced through the gully One peculiarity in the striations deserves notice as showing the direction from which the starting agent moved The strike were most numerous and deepest on the east side suggesting that the starting agent had moved in a direction from a more westerly point than N.W. The rock surfaces facing the S. and 5. W. were neither striated nor smoothed There is another spot on the south side of Arthur’s Seat, worthy of notice on account of the boulders there and the position occupied by them It is on the west side of Windy Gowl. When the new road was being made there a thick bed of clay and sand in stratified layers was exposed to view In this bed many blocks from the overhanging rocks of the hill were found embedded The bed of sand and clay had been formed round these boulders showing 844 Proceedings of the Royal Society that affer they fell sedimentary matter brought by water had been deposited The largest of the blocks was round and smooth on its west side rough and angular on its east side Besides the blocks of stone which were of the same nature as the rocks of Arthur’s Seat, there were in this bed of sand and clay blocks foreign to Arthur’s Seat brought from the west probably viz red compact felspar red sienitic porphyry marine limestone and clay iron stone o At Easter Duddingstone the excavations for the North British Railway exposed a number of large boulders embedded in the stiff blue till Two of the boulders were of Old Red Sandstone Con- glomerate—one an old porphyry one a black basalt—rocks not existing in the immediate neighbourhood but belonging fo localities in the far west Most of them were on their upper surfaces flat smooth and striated the strike running in directions varying between N.W. and W.N. W, At the seashore between Joppa and Magdalen Bridge, the Con- veer examined many large boulders sticking in the blue fill most of them flattened on their upper surfaces with strike pointing N.N.W. Several presented smoothing and furrows on their west sides none on their east sides One of the boulders presented two sets of strim—one running N,N.W., the other running W, by S,, the former partly obliterated by the latter which therefore must have been the more recent - | 3. Dalmahoy~—Two boulders one 13 xbox 6 feet and the other 10 x 8 x 5 feet He. at the side of the Water of Leith. The longer axis of both is E. and W. Both were covered with strike also running E. and W. (Sizth Report, p.’27). 4. Craiglockhart.—Excavations were made in boulder clay for a hydropathic establishment A number of boulders were seen by Convener in their original undisturbed positions There were several of sandstone The contractor for the building having his attention drawn to these by the Convener, was asked of he knew any locality where there was sandstone rock of the same variety Ile said that the sandstone rock quarried extensively at Hailes and at Redhall was exactly the same On being asked to indicate the situation of these quarries he pointed in a direction N.W. by compass distant about a miles of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84. 845 5. Tynecastle, in west suburbs of Edinburgh.— A basaltic boulder examined by Convener and Mr Stevenson, C.E., 4} x 4 x 2 feet buried in a knoll of muddy sand discovered on removal of the knoll The sand contained numerous pebbles of all kinds hard and soft such as quartz shale coal Height above sea 200 feet Sides of boulder well rounded Smallest end of boulder pointed westward Both upper and under sides of boulder striated Strice more deeply cut on under than on upper surface The strip on under surface showed they had begun to be formed at east end of boulder probably by the boulder having been pushed towards east over hard rocks  The strike on upper surface showed that the tools which formed them had acted on the boulder first at west end 6. Granton.—The sandstone rocks at the Old Quarry near the sea were covered by boulder clay which had embedded in it many blocks derived from Linlithgow and Stirling shires The strike on their upper surfaces all run E. and W., viz.,, a direction parallel with the general axis of the Firth of Forth (Edin. New Phil. Journal for January 1847). At Granton Harbour, on the west side of at the shore there are two large whinstone boulders with strike on their upper surfaces the direction of which is W, 3° S. (magnetic). 7. Leith Docks.—In new Albert Docks excavations were made in the boulder clay in course of which a number of large boulders were found | They consisted mostly of blue whinstone also some of quartz limestone greywacke, sandstone and black ironstone concretion derived from beds of coal and shale On most of the boulders there were smoothed surfaces and street bearing nearly the same direction viz points between W, and N. Among these there were two metallic boulders which having a strange appearance were brought to the Convener by the Inspector of Works ; and to Professor Crum Brown of Edinburgh University), the Convener submitted them for examination One, nearly sphere call measuring 71 inches in circumference and weighing 26 oz had been found about 41 feet down in the clay bed among the general mass of boulders The other more exactly spherical measured in girth 30 inches one way and 31 inches transversely and weighed 54 abs Tt was found 10 feet below the top of the boulder clay bed 846 Proceedings of the Royal Society Professor Crum Brown having analysed both balls reported - the largest to have a specific gravity of 3-36, and to be composed of silica 523 per cents and of pyrates 477 per cents The smallest had a specific gravity of 4'63, and was found to consist of the pure ore of while iron pyrates or marcasite unmixed with any other sub stance ~ Mr Murray, of the “Challenger” Expedition, having kindly under taken to examine the larger ball reported that a microscopic ex lamination revealed that it consisted of crystalline particles of quartz and marcasite The marcasite fills the intestines between the grains of quartz and among the quartz there are pieces of mica Mr Charles Peach at the same time informed the Convener that in several districts to the west (viz., Falkirk, Slamannan, and Kilsyth) there are beds of shale and coal containing ironstone nodules known among the miners as “ brassy balls some of which contain marcasite He added that the direction of the sure and carry of the boulders in this the Kilsyth) district is E. or E. 5° N, Either of these sources the remarked could supply balls at Leith, as they are right in the direction of the “ice-flow” (Fourth Eeport, pa 29). ~ | | In consequence of the foregoing information the Convener went to Campsie about 8 miles N.E. from Glasgow), and in the work ings of coal and shale there he obtained several ironstone balls which on being submitted to Professor Crum Brown, he reported contained almost exactly the same constituents as the specimens found at Leith. He added that deducting the coal matter the iron and sulphur were in the proportion in which they are generally found in marcasite viz iron 45'6, and sulphur 54-8. As to chemical compositions therefore the small metallic boulder may be considered as exactly agreeing with the nodules found in the Campsie coal strata ‘With regard to the larger ball not so purely metallic Mr Hutchi- son of Carlowrie having accidentally seen in the Convener’s house Edinburgh, the specimen excavated from the Leith boulder clay informed the Convener that balls of the same appearance and much larger were found in sandstone rocks quarried at Dalmeny and Humbie, The Convener thereupon visited these quarries and of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84. 847 saw several specimens of such balls apparently concretion in the rock Having brought one or two specimens to Edinburgh, he submitted them to Professor Crum Brown, who reported that they ““ consist externally of a thin shell of sandstone and internally of a mixture of quartz and marcasite closely resembling the substance of the large ball from Leith. The mean specific gravity of the ball was 3'49.” | These facts regarding the two metallic boulders found in the Leith boulder clay therefore afford strong presumptive evidence that they had been transported across Scotland, along with other boulders whose parent rocks occur also in the west As to the mode of transport Mr Peach, in his letter to the Con- veer printed on pa 29 of Fourth Boulder Report), whilst allowing that the balls might have come from Kilsyth or Slamannan, in con forty with the general direction of the strike and carry of the boulders in this district viz E., or E. 5° N., suggested ‘““zce-flow as the medium of transport but without explaining whether he meant sea ice or land ice With reference to this question it is right to keep in view that the Campsie district from which the metallic boulders are assumed to have come is only 150 feet above the present sea-level ; and that as this district is about 30 miles distant from Leith, the gradient would not be sufficient for the movement of a glacier even if there had been mountains at or near Campsie sufficiently high to have generated a glacier 8. Alnwick Hill, near Liberton.—Excavations having been made in the boulder clay here for the formation of large water reservoirs innumerable boulders were excavated They were chiefly whine stones felspar porphyries, limestones and Old Red Sandstone—all most probably from the N. W, | Some of these boulders showed strike both on the under and the upper sides the direction of which was appi*oxima,tely N.W. (Fourth Report, pa 29). Inghkeith.—The Convener visited the island under the guidance of Colonel Muggridge, R.E., and found that the rocks consist chiefly of basalt and porphyry intruding among coal strata In various * A small map of district given afterwards in reference to Stirlingshire boulders may here be referred to. 848 Proceedings of the Royal Society places the rocks were covered by beds of boulder-clay, gravel and occasionally sand The Inspector of Works informed the Convener, that at the east end of the island when removing a bed of shingle about 60 feet above the sea he had picked up out of the shingle two pebbles of red granite about the size of a hens eggs Thinking it curious to find granite there he had laid them aside but could not now find them The Convener, having been informed that there was a shingle beach at the N.W. end of the island descended to it, and found large pebbles of granite both red and grey gneiss quartz and hard Silurian rocks | On the highest part of the island west of the Lighthouse) at 182 feet above the sea the rocks on portions of the hill facing the N.W. have been planed down to even surfaces by some agency from the W. No strike were distinguishable (Sixth Report, pa 26). MORAYSHIRE. Dyle.—Near west end of approach to Darnaway Castle several boulders of granite and gneiss from 2 to 3 tons each Forres.—Conglomerate boulder 94 x 8 x 8 feet weighing ahout 44 tons It is situated on hill side fronting Cromarty, which bears N.W. by N., from whence boulders are supposed to have come across the Moray Firth, | Convener heard of another boulder of same description in a higher part of the hill to the eastward Elgin.—Boulder called ¢ Carlin’s Stone,” on Bogton Farm, about 230 feet above scan a coarse Conglomerate. About half a mile to N. W. a smaller Conglomerate boulder called ¢ Young Curlin’s Stone” (First Report, pa 31, and Second Report, pa 152). There are no Conglomerate rocks in the low-lying districts where these boulders are situated Wherever they have come from they must have been carried | Conglomerate rocks exist in the hills to the south distant 5 or 6 miles Convener was informed by Mr Martin, teacher Elgin well acquainted with the rocks of the district that the Conglomerate for nations in the hills are in mineralogical composition distinguishable of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84. 849 from the Conglomerate boulders in the counties of Moray, Nairn, and Banff. Two other sources were considered by him more pro bable—Cromarty to the N.W., and the hills near the east end of the Caledonian Canal. | Throughout the county there are hundreds of rounded boulders of granite gneiss and mica slate whose shape suggests that they have been pushed or rolled over the surface These are chiefly em bedded in gravel clay and sand Pluscardine Hll has had lodged on its north slope a number of boulders which have apparently come from N.W. There is a gneiss boulder 13 x 8 x 6 feet about 46 tons called “Chapel Stone,” situated to west of Pluscardine Chapel; also a Syenite boulder 12 x 8 x 3 feet about 13 tons The rocks in situ here are Old Red Sandstone. | Carden Hill forms a rocky sandstone range running about E.and W. Between it and Pluscardine Hill, there is a shallow valley through which boulders may have been rafted to their present sites in an easterly direction The two Carlin Stones might have come that way The rocks along ridge of Carden Hill, have been ground down by some agent which has passed over it from N.W. Many boulders of granite and gneiss lie on the ridge most of which have longer axis N.W. by W. Some lie along ridge on its northern edge apparently stopped there in their farther progress others lie on south side of ridge as if pushed over it, and placed beyond reach of transporting agent | Blocks of the Carden Hill sandstone rock are also there as if broken off the ridge by the agent which passed over from north The ridge of Carden Hill extends for about a miles and is at a height of 400 feet above sea Many smoothed and striated surfaces are visible the direction of the stri having been observed at different places as follows:—W. by N.; W.N.W.; NNW. by W,, and N'W.

There are granite rocks in hills to south on which blocks of Old Red Sandstone lie and in such quantities that they are gathered for the building of walls These blocks probably came from the north where there are rocks of the same kind (F#%rst Report, pa 42, and Second Report, pa 166) (Lithograph No. 36, Plate X.). | On ¢ Piper’s Hill,” where rocks are Old Red Sandstone, a Con- glomerate boulder weighing about 10 tons lies on the N.W, side of a gravel aim These Conglomerate boulders are all mineralogical similar being composed of quartz limestone syenite felspar and other hard angular pebbles Most of them are partly buried in sandy drift The district on which they lie slopes down towards N.W., and is about 200 feet above sea from which distant about a miles The longer axis of these boulders is chiefly N.W., and on that side they present smooth surfaces whilst east side is rough and angular see Diagram 8 in Second Report and pa 166, and also First Report, pa 42). Captain White of Ordnance Survey informed Convener that having tried to find out where these boulders came from he was of opinion that they had come from Ross-shire. ~ He reported also having met with granite boulders both red and grey varieties)—the largest 12 x 84 x 8 feet and with longest axis N.W. ‘ A aim of gravel and sand with steep sides runs on an average - E. and W. through parish but occasionally deviates slightly from this direction Its average height above adjoining district is 30 feet (Second Report, pa 166). | Ardelach.—In Bog of Fortnightly, about 5 miles distant from the sea and about 270 feet above it, a Conglomerate boulder with five sides having girth of 51 feet and 9 feet above ground The block is scarcely rounded at its edges and corners and therefore has probably been carried not pushed rolled or thrown down but planted gently on ifs site It is smoothest on N.W. side roughest on S.E. It is surrounded by hills on every side except towards N.W. (First Report, pa 42).

Mr Wallace of Inverness mentions having found a specimen of this Kinsteary granite beside Buckie harbour about 20 miles east of Lossiemouth (Sizth Report, pa 49), and he has seen many smaller specimens in the fields Neither rock nor boulders of this peculiar granite have been found west of Nairn. NORTHUMBERLAND. In Chillingham Park (Earl Tankerville’s seat between Wooler and Alnwick, there is a large boulder of red porphyry besides several small boulders of granite  The rocks there in sifu are Carboniferous sandstone and limestones The nearest localities for porphyry and granite are the Cheviot Hills, about 8 miles to W.N.W., which reach a height of 1800 feet above sea ~Many ridges and valleys lie in the intervening district (Fourth Report, pa 34, and Edin.

In a paper on the “Glaciation of the Orkneys,” by Messrs Peach and Horne of the Government Scotch Geological Survey (London Geological Society’s Journal for November 1880), it is said that boulders do not occur very plentifully The only island in which boulders are mentioned as seen by them is Westra, where ¢ blocks of granite and quartzite are on the slopes of Cleat Hill; and rounded boulders of red sandstone from Eda occur in the southern district as well as along the western shores Messrs Peach and Horne state that the only part of the Orkneys which has granite or other crys tagline rocks is at Strommness, where they form a strip about 4 miles long by 1 in breadth If the Westra boulders came from Strom- ness they must have been transported about 40 miles in a N, or N.N.E. direction across what now is occupied by several groups of islands and deep sea sounds | If, on the other theory the boulders of sandstone on the southern and western shores of Westra came from Eda was suggested in the above passage they must have been transported about 10 to 12 miles in a N.W. direction across what is now a sea sounds in some places 25 fathoms deep Messrs Horne and Peach, in the memoir now referred to, red fearing to the beds of red boulder clay inthe islands of Zda, Sanday, Stromsa, and Shapinshay, mention that in these clay beds there are boulders smoothed and striated most of them ¢ foreign to the islands and in many cases accompanied by “ numerous frag ments of marine shells ;”—* these fragments being smoothed and striated like the stones in the boulder clay,”—* characteristics which they say there can be no doubt are due to the very same cause in both cases app 656, 657).

E. Objections to that theory were suggested by the Convener, in articles which appeared in the Geological Magazine for 1881, and in an address by him to the Edlnburgh Geological Society in May 1881. In addition to the foregoing notes respecting Orkney boulders it is proper to notice the researches of Messrs Peach and Horne. In a paper published in the Journal of the London Geological Society for November 1880, it is mentioned as the result of their survey that the islands have been emaciated in one determinate direction independently of their physical features When we con side that the emaciated surfaces along the cliff tops as well as the riches moutonnées on the hill-slopes, prove that the islands must have been overflowed by ice we cannot resist the conclusion that the ice of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84. 855 movement during the primary glaciation originated beyond the limits of Orkney” up 654). - “From the manner in which the rock striations maintain their N.W. bend irrespective of the physical features of the country it is evident that the agent which produced them must have acted independently of the islands up 660).

Ben Wyvis (3426 feet near Dingwall.—Its N.W. smoulder prep sent whole acres of rock swept bare of soil with rounded and polished boulders of a peculiar veined granite identified with rocks to the westward in the tract called Dirriemore. These boulders are found half way up Ben Wyvis. Similar boulders occur strewed over the country both north (Alness and Ault Grand), and south (Strathgarve) of Ben Wyvis. In Strathgarve some of the boulders are as large as cottages (Furst Report, pa 48). Dirriemore.—Mr Jolly of Inverness states that the peculiar granite of this district has been carried ¢ eastward none of it “westward.” it has been carried across the Cromarty Firth, and scattered in large masses even over the Black Isle. It is plentiful over the ¢ Laigh of Moray” and along the seashore between Burghead and Lossiemouth (Sizth Report, pa 47). Mr Wallace of Inverness also reports having seen Dirriemore of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84. 863 granite in numerous boulders in the excavations for the new harbour at Buckie in Banffshire (Sixth Report, pa 49). Edderton west of Tain).—Three large boulders of grey granite pointed out to Convener at about 1000 feet above sea on side of hills sloping down towards N.N.W. Rocks on which they rest are Old Red. A horizontal terrace is site of one The idea that they came from * Cairn nu Cunneig” (Hill of Pilcher), situated 12 miles to N.W. was suggested by Rev. Mr Joass of Golspie), is disputed as rocks there are stated to be a red granite Another idea is that they came from hills near Rogart, 10 or 12 miles to N. or N. by E., as rocks there said to be grey granite (First Report, pa 49, and Second Report, pa 175), | Fannich Mountains situated west of Ben Wyvis).—Mr J.

The prevailing rock on Tulloch Hill is bluish-grey indicated sandstone slate Where strata crop out on opposite side of valley their edges have been rubbed and smoothed on their north faces by some natural agency moving in a direction from N. W, On north slope of Tulloch Hill a moor stretches up to height of about 1100 feet on which many small boulders of same kind as above,—and to be found also all the way down to Cromarty Firth. Mr Morrison set out on an excursion to west with the idea of discovering the direction from which these Tulloch boulders had - come At Achna-Clerach he found ‘“ a gigantic mass of the same kind of granite as the boulders 25 x 23 x 12 feet,—the rock on which it was resting being different from that of the boulders At the confluence of the rivers Glascarnoch and Strathvaick he found rock of the same variety as the Tulloch boulders but at a lower level than Tulloch Hill. He inferred that the boulders had been carried eastwards over the south smoulder of Little Wyvis, and that they probably came from Carn-Cuineag through the open ing occupied by Loch (Glass.” Mr Morrison, accompanied by some geological friends proceeded next to Cairn Cunneay, 2744 feet above sea It is the highest hill in Easter Ross. Its two peaks or Pifcher lugs are pinnacles of granite Its slopes are covered by enormous masses of granite semi-cubical in shape An opinion was formed that most of the boulders in Easter Ross had been derived from this mountain and its lesser neighbours Carn-Maine, and Carn an Lochan. The saddle between the two peaks appears like a shingle beach ; grounded stones of about 10 pounds weight are packed here and of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84. 865 there in crevices with longer axes of the stones lying generally in one and the same direction RoXBURGHSHIRE, Castleton.—Many blocks of granite red and grey varieties lie on greywacke and Carboniferous rocks,—which apparently came from Dumfries and Kirkcudbright shires 30 to 40 miles distant crossing Esk and other rivers (Swcth Report, pa 28). Rounded boulders of grey granite occur on the fields and moors near Castleton Mansge, where Convener saw several from 3 to 4 feet in diameter On east bank of River Esk, about 2 miles below Lang- holm Convener saw granite boulders—both red and grey varieties some of them very large A number occur also in the Gill burn which flows into the Liddell above its junction with the Esk. These granite blocks lie on the greywacke strata as well as on the coal measures The nearest known hill of granite is Criffel, which consists almost entirely of grey granite situated about 20 miles W.S.W. from these boulders The next nearest place where granite rocks occur is in Aytshire, at Loch Doune, bearing about W. by N, from the boulders In a small stream north of Tofts House; and about three quarters of a mile east of Edgerstone, there were seen by Convener several angular blocks of greywacke, resting on a purplish porphyry rock The nearest point where there are greywacke rocks in situ is about half a mile to west between which however and these blocks there is a porphyry hill several hundred feet high There is no greywacke to the south or east (*“Geological Account of Roxburghshire,” Trans. Edwn. Roy. Soc., vole xvi pa 412). In this parish there is a remarkable aim composed partly of gravel partly of sand in horizontal beds It runs for about half a mile ; is about 200 feet wide at based and from 50 to 60 feet high In the gravel there are blocks and pebbles of granite both red and grey as well as fragments of shale and coal,—derived, no doubt from rocks to the westward The aim forms nearly a straight line the direction of which is N.E. by E.

Nesbit.—Near the village about 8 miles S.W. of Kelso) a green stone boulder identical in composition with rocks on Penielheugh Hill, on which stands Waterloo Pillar. Boulder is on a knoll alittle to N.W. of top of knoll Penielheugh is S.W. from boulder and about a mile distant Transporting agent moved therefore here in a N.E. direction Hill is 774 feet above sea and boulder 224 feet above sea Rocks where boulder lies are Old Red Sandstone. Ruberslaw.—On this hill a large boulder of greywacke found by Convener, lying on Old Red Sandstone rocks Nearest greywacke rocks in situ are about 3 miles to westward If boulder came from these greywacke rocks it must have crossed low ground 800 feet below level of boulder (Zdin. Roy. Soc. Trans., vole xvi pa 454). SELKIRKSHIRE. Galashiels.—On the top of Meigle Hill, 1430 feet above the sea there is a Silurian boulder 6 x 41 x 3% feet with its longer axis N.W. and its sharpest end pointing in that direction The boulder is on the east side of the apex of the hill and 12 feet below it. It is Iying on drift Meigle Hill is composed of Silurian rocks It stands by itself ; there being no hills of equal altitude within some miles of it. Other boulders of a smaller size occur on the hill They seemed to the Convener to be all erratic (Sizth Report, pa 30). SHETLAND. Brassay Island.—A number of coarse white sandstone boulders on east side of island at heights of from 40 to 360 feet above the sea differing from rocks in sifu which consist of Conglomerate and Old Red Sandstone flags Largest boulder six 7 xu feet Its longer axis N.W. There are said to be distinct grooving on it, some of them 3 inches deep;—their direction E. and W.

The Rev. James Russell, in 1873 who was then resident in Walls), visited the island and refers to several boulders—situated in the south half of the island,—the north half he had not examined From the middle of the island to south end he reported drift as high up as 700 feet containing much granite and gneiss which he supposed to have come from Mainland. In the middle of the island there are two boulders of irregular shape each weighing about 2 tons,—their composition he does not mention Mr Russell stated that at the south end of the island there are three boulders of gneiss and two boulders of granite each weighing from 3 to 5 cwt.,, and which he supposed came from the Culswick and Delting Hills on Mainland, towards the N.E. Messrs Peach and Horne, on the other hands suggest that these boulders may belong to rocks iz situ on Foula itself inasmuch as the eastern part of the island they say consists of gneissose rocks with a mass of granite in the N.E. corner (Geol. Mag. for August 1881, pa 372), Messrs Peach and Horne, however mention that they discovered in the boulder clay of Foula a block of epidemic syenite from Dun- grossness a locality which bears 8.E. from Foula, separated by sea at least 50 miles in breadth and having a depth of 70 fathoms Houssay Island.—On a cliff 200 feet above sea there are loose blocks resting on rounded and polished rocky knoll the kills having been evidently polished before receiving the boulders (First Report, pa 43). Papa Stour Island was visited by the late Dr Hibbert in the year 1822 (Edin. Journ. Science for 1831, vol ivy pa 86). He found in it several peculiar schisms foreign to the island apparently derived from rocks at Hilswick Ness, situated to the N.E., and distant about 12 miles across St Magnus Bay, which has a depth of 40 fathoms This island was visited also by Professor Geikie, who states that he found on it many ¢ transported blocks of gneiss schist and other rocks foreign to the locality ” (Nature, vole xvi pa 415). 868 Proceedings of the Royal Society Besides the boulders pointed out by Dr Hibbert, Messrs Peach and Horne say that on Papa Stour they saw others of ¢ Old Red rocks derived from the area occupied by the rocks between Sand- ness and Bixiter Voe;”—places on Mainland, situated to the +S.E. of Papa Stour, and separated from it by an arm of the sea Hilswick Ness, the south end of an isthmus on the north side of St Magnus Bay. | Dr Hibbert refers to a transported boulder on the summit of this promontory describing it as a surprising block of granite ;— removed from a rock the nearest site of which is about 2 miles north ” (Edwn. Journ. Science, vole ivy pa 89). Messrs Peach and Horne, who had not mentioned this boulder in their paper averting to Dr Hibbert’s notice of it, say that ¢ this boulder might have been derived from some of the masses of the same material lying at a slightly greater distance fo the E. and N.E. of Hilswick ” (Geol. Mag. for August 1881, pa 372). If that view be taken the transport must have been across an arm of the get running N. and S. on the east side of Hilswick Ness. Roeness Hill, on North Mavine, 1476 feet high.—Dr Hibbert says this hill being * composed of red granite I was struck with the immense number of boulders of a primary greenstone which appear to have been removed from a life 2 or 3 miles off and to have been brought in a southerly or southwesterly direction up a gradual ascent of 3 or 4 miles (Edin. Journ. Science, vole ivy pa 89). Messrs Peach and Horne admit the facts as here stated They say they ¢ entirely support our conclusions viz.,, of the boulder having been carried up hill by the Scandanavian ice-sheet, in a S.W. direction ” (Geol. Mag. for August 1881, pa 371). Additional Localities.—The Rev. Dr Gordon of Birnie visited Shetland in the year 1872, and sent to the Committee the following notes (1) Boulders.—Near North Mavine the extreme north of Main- land there are large boulders between Hilswick and Ollaberry. He sent to the Committee pencil sketches of three boulders situated in the same North Mavine district between St Maghus Bay and Yell Sound. They are sienitic One near Eela water is 16 x 12 x 6 feet Another called Crupna bent is 11 x 8 x 8 feet The third called Bonhus, situated between the other two is 8 x 10 x 11 feet of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84. 869 - (2) Striee on rocks seen by Dr Gordon, at two places about 20 miles asunder one a mile north of the fishing huts of Stennis on N.W, shore of St Magnus Bay, on coarse Conglomerate rock The other place was at Islebury, where there is a valley running N, and S. The strip showed that starting agent had crossed valley in E. and W. direction (Second Report, pa 177). Lunnasting—Stones of Stoffus.—Specimens from these blocks were shown to late Professor Nicol of Aberdeen, who after examination considered them to be gneiss the same as the rock of the island They are from 20 to 22 feet high and 90 feet in girth Height above sea 100 to 120 feet The Professor, from the account given to him of them thought the stones had probably been carried ,"—there being no land near them at a higher level (Second Report, pa 193). The following notes were sent to Convener, by some person evidently well acquainted with the locality but whose name has unfortunately not been preserved :— Four boulders looking like pale granite on the estate of Lunna. Nos. 1, 2, and 3 stand near each other in north part of parish not far from sea and at a height above sea-level of from 150 to 200 feet No. 1 is in height 22 feet length 36 feet ; breadth 25 feet angular in shape ; direction of longest axis N.W, No. 2 is in height 19 feet length 34 feet breadth 14 feet ; angular direction of longest axis N.E. No. 3 is in eight 11 feet 4 in ; length 8 feet 7 in ; breadth 8 feet 2 in ; direction of longest axis N W, Nos. 1 and 2 separated from each other by a distance of 10 or 12 feet ; the intervening space being filled with large masses which have apparently fallen from No. 2. Nos. 1 and 2, known as ¢ The stones of Stoffas.” This word said to be a corruption of ““ Stay fast the legend being that two giants were passing through Lunnaness, when some superior power arrested their farther progress by pronouncing the words * Stoffas/” No. 4 stands by itself surrounded by deep moss within a few yards of the highest point of a hill about 4 miles to the south of the other three stones | Note by Convener.—The stones of Stoffas are referred to by late Dr Hibbert, in his volume on Shetland. He describes them as “ enormous detached masses which do not seem to have undergone 870 Proceedings of the Royal Society any distant removal since they repose on rocks of a precisely similar kind ” up 179). Professor Heddle of St Andrews informs Convener that he examined these stones and thought they had been detached and wrenched off from other rocks and moved in a direction towards E.S.E. (Zighth Report, pa 7). Fair Isle Parish.—Rev. Mr Laurence, catechism reported that there are no boulders above 10 tons but that there are several small boulders of Conglomerate quite differing from any rocks in island (Evghth Report, pa T) | He adds that there was one large block of sandstone which was blown up in 1880. It differed from any rocks in island and was similar to the Kday sandstone The island of Eday is about 13 miles to S,S.W. of Fair Isle (Ezghth Report, pa 8). North Unst.—All over Unst the rocks show abrasions and in many places deposits of drift enclosing stones of various sizes Mr Peach, senior at the request of the late Sir Roderick Murchison, examined this most northern isle of the Shetlands, and gave in a Report to the British Association in the year 1864. - He stated that he ascended the Muckle Heog - Hill, reaching to a height of 500 feet and found the W.N.W. end vertical and polished to the depth of at least 150 feet Professor Geikie in an article in Nature, of with September 1877, refers to the foregoing report by Mr Peach, and says that from his own observations he can speak confidently as to the correctness of Mr Peach’s deter minations,” , Sumburgh Head.—Conglomerate boulder lying on sandstone rocks (Second Report, pa 44). In addition to the information in the foregoing notes regarding boulders it is right to refer to the information given by Messrs Peach and Horne in their paper on the Shetlands) regarding the extent to which all the hills even the highest show traces of glacial tion (Jour. of Lond. Geol. Soc. for November 1879). They saythat ¢ from Sumburgh Head northwards to Unst we found everywhere the clearest evidence that Shetland must have been at one time smothered in ice up 706). ¢ Jt1is apparent on a moments consideration that the direction of of Ldvnburgh, Session 1883-84. 871 the strike would have been widely different had the island radiated its own ice and had the glaciation been purely local ” up 791). “ For these various reasons we are justified in inferring that the glaciation of these outlying islets is due to the action of an ice-sheet originating far beyond the sphere of Shetland” up 792). “The highest ground in the centre of the Mainland is likewise ground down and striated 'The ridge which extends from Weesdale Hill (842 feet to Scallafield (216 feet reveals the fine lines as well the fluting of the ice-chisel ” up 793).

Kilsyth and Strathblane—Mr Jack, of Scotch Government Geological Survey, reported two boulders,—one of mica slate weight ing about 6 toms 1260, feet above sea its parent rock supposed by him to be to the N., and distant 15 miles The other boulder is Conglomerate, 8 x 4 x 3 feet its longer axis being W, 20° N., its parent rock supposed by him to be also to N.W. (First Report, pa 51). 3. Campsie.—Mr John Young of the Hunterian Museum, Glasgow, accompanied Convener to an inspection of the district near Campsie, and pointed out the following objects of interest :—(1) On Craigend Moor, about 450 feet above sea sandstone rock presented great sheets of smoothed surface evidently ground down by severe or long-continued friction with oc;,cas.ioﬁal strike running S.E. by S, In some places there were quartz pebbles in the sandstone rock which were ground down showing marks of rubbing chiefly on the N.W. sides At four other places there were striations on rocks pointing red selectively S.E. by 8. and S.E. § 8., S.E. by S., S.8.E. | Looking from this moor towards the N.W., hills are seen about a 1000 feet high at one place with an opening between them of about 1} miles in width through which if there was a current it might pass over Craigend Moor. 872 Proceedings of the Royal Society Several boulders were pointed out. Two were of a species of trap common in the Kilpatrick Hills, situated some miles to W.N. W, Another boulder was a grey granite which judging from the size of its felspar crystals Mr Young supposed might have come from Ben Awe, a mountain situated to N.W., and distant about 30 miles There were also several Conglomerate boulders derived probably from the belt of that rock which running from Dumbarton, crosses Loch Lomond in a N.E. direction towards Aberfoyle. The Convener at another time when on Campsie Hills, found rocks at 800 feet above the sea striated in a direction E. and W. On the Kilsyth Hills, a few miles further east the rock strike point the same way On Croy Hill, a knoll of trap rock being the summit level between the Firths of Clyde and Forth, about 160 feet above the sea there ‘15 an immense accumulation of boulders Some of the boulders are of old Conglomerate, which must have come from the westward and stuck on the knoll (Fowrth Report, pa 42). The relative positions of these localities may be more readily understood by referring to the annexed map   4. St Ninians.—Boulder weighing about 200 tons at height of 1250 feet above sea reported by Mr J ack but no particulars given (First Report, pa 51). | 5. Sheriffmuir, 3 miles from Bridge of Allan, a large boulder called ‘“ Wallace’s Putting Stone ” (Fourth Report, pa 34). of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84. 873 6. Sterling and Doune districis.—Conglomerate boulders occur at the following localities (Sixth Report, pa 31):— (1) At Kilbride, boulder of about 900 tons mentioned under Perthshire). (2) On Landrick Estate, boulder of about 360 tons (3) At Keltie Bridge, boulder weighing about 60 tons (4) On Gartincaber, boulder weighing about 16 tons (5) On North side of River Teith, boulder weighing about 13 tons (6) In the Burn of Campsie, two boulders each weighing about 13 and 24 tons (7) In the district traversed by the hill road between Doune and Callander, multitudes of smaller size (8) At Corntan Brickwork between Stirling and Brldge of Allan), small boulder found in bed of clay (9) On the rocks adjoining Stirling Castle on the north small Conglomerate boulders besides others of gneiss and greywacke. (10) At Loch Coulter and Gullies Hill places 3 miles south of Stirling), several Conglomerate boulders besides others of mica slate and felspar porphyry (11) On Plgan Estate (4 miles S.E. of Stirling), boulders of Con- glomerate, gneiss granite greywacke, and whinstone (12) At Glenbervie, near Torwood (& miles S.8.E. of Stirling), a Conglomerate boulder 6 feet square found by Convener. | (13) On Dunmore Estate (9 miles S.E. of Stirling), a Conglomerate boulder of about 10 tons found by Convener. A more particular account of the foregoing boulders may be found in “The Estuary of the Forth,”* pa 41, where it will be seen that all those which are elongated in shape generally have their longer axis in a direction N.W. and S.E. There can be no doubt that all these boulders had been carried from hills situated to the N.W., near Callander and Aberfoyle, as there are rocks there of the kind composing the boulders and in no nearer district On the north side of Stirleng Clastle the trap rocks are traversed by narrow gorges running about E. and W., the sides of which in many places present smoothing and tried especially on the south sides indicating transport from a point a little to the north of west * Edmonston & Douglas, Publishers (1871). 874 Proceedings of the Royal Society The strike are generally horizontal but occasionally are inclined slightly upwards towards the east | A few small boulders well rounded occur in several of the gorges Among them granites and conglomerates were observed Craigrorth Hill, about 2 miles west of Stirling, has smoothing on its rocks near the top (198 feet above sea and a few strike running in a N.W, and S.E. direction The Convener found on it also small boulders apparently from rocks situated at or near Aberfoyle which bears W. 2 N. from Craigforth. On or near the Racecourse at Stirling situated S. W. from the Castle), about 130. to 160 feet above the sea there are several granite boulders lying on smoothed sandstone rocks The largest is ex 3 xu feet It is on a rocky knoll the smoothest part of which slopes down towards N.N.W. As the boulder from its composition most probably came from the hills situated to the N.W., it must have lodged on what would be the [ee side of the knoll 7. Aberfoyle.—~—Arndrum Hill, reaching to height of 454 feet above sea forms part of the ridge of Conglomerate rock which traverses country in a N.E, and S. W. direction by Callander and Loch Lomond. On this ridge Professor Heddle, at a height of 230 feet found a line of six boulders of angular gneiss stretching N, and S, They are from 2 to 20 feet apart and are from three-quarters to 3 cubic yards in size To the west of this kine four other similar boulders lay along the summit of the ridge and thus at right angles to the first line (Ninth Report, pa 16). | SUTHERLANDSHIRE, Assynt.—Two large boulders one at Unapool, the other at Stonechrubie, called “Clach na Patain” (Stone of the Button) (First Report, pa 51). Golspre.—An Old Red Sandstone boulder 16 x 10 x 4 feet about 248 feet above sea lying on politic rocks,—subangular,—with longer axis N.N.W. Three smaller boulders of Old Red Sandstone lie about 100 yards to S.E. The Old Red Sandstone formation is situated to N. and W., about 3 miles from those boulders ( First Report, pa 51). Rev. Mr Joass, of Golspie, refers to a large boulder of gneiss Weiihini about 120 tons called ¢ Clach Mhie Mhios” ‘ Clach being   of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84. 875 Gaelic for *“ Stone,” “ Mhie,” of a son “ Mhios,” of a month ; this name having been given by legend that stone was thrown from a hill 2 miles distant by a child of Fingal, when only one month old first Report, pa 10) West and North Coasts.—The late Robert Chambers visited the west coast of Sutherland, travelling round by Cape Wrath, and along the north coast as far as Tongue Bay, with the following results :— | 1. At a height of 1700 and 1800 feet he found strip on the rocks of Cuineag and Canish quartz hills in Assynt, about 30 miles north of Gairloch), running from about N: 60° W. with certain exceptions One of these exceptions was ab the base of Cuineag, where the streaks are from the direct worth apparently by reason of a turn or deflection which the agent had there received at and by reason of the base of an adjoining hill Another exception was at the hollow dividing the mass of the hill from its loftiest top where another system of streaking had come in from the direct west 2. On a summit south from Ben More; fully 1500 feet high and 4 or 5 miles to the south of Cuineag, there are streaking on the quartz observing the normal direction of this general movement viz from N. 60° W 3. On the gneiss platform between Cowl More and Sulvean Dr Chambers found polished surfaces striated from N.'W. and from W. To the west and north of the latter mountain are markings in all respects similar These are situations observes Chambers, where no local glaciers could exist 4. Streakings precisely the same as those on Cuineag and Canish exist at an elevation of at least 2000 feet on the similar quartz mountain called Ben Eay, south of Loch Maree, and 40 miles from Assynt this striation being from N.W. or thereabouts and totally irrespective of the form of the hill 5. Passing northward to Rhiconish, we find near that place strip coming in from the coast viz from the N.W.,, and passing across a high moors with no regard whatever to the inequalities of the ground 6. A little farther north at Laxford, a fine surface is marked with striations from the N.W., being across the valley in which is 876 Proceedings of the Royal Sociely occurs At an opening in the bold * gneiss coast which looks out upon the Pentland Firth, there is strong marking in a direction from N.N.W. The high desolate tract between Loch Eribol and Tongue Bay, where there is nothing that could restrain or guide the move ment of the ice exhibits striations from N. 28° W. Strie in nearly the same direction viz N. 25° W., occur 4 miles to the east of Tongue. On perfectly free ground at Armadale, the markings point almost directly from the north When we pass on to Caithness we find traces of striations still from points between N, and N.W., which is directly transverse to a line pointing to the neighbouring hills (Fifth Report, pa 62). The late Professor Nicol observes that ¢ on the whole N.W. coast from Cape Wrath southwards numerous perched boulders occur on summits and sides of hills in most exposed situations They are especially numerous around Loch Maree” (First Report, pa 51). In another paper (Brit. Assoc. Reports for 1855, pa 89) the Pro- lessor states that on the west coast of Sutherland, near Loch Laxford, enormous blocks are perched on the top of rounded bosses or on the very verge of precipices As the slightest impulse seems sufficient to dislodge these boulders the manner in which they were placed in their present positions is very problematical It is matter of regret that no reports came to the Committee red guarding the boulders on the N.W. and N. coasts of Sutherlandshire, though frequent applications for them were made For want of reports it has been thought right to refer to the foregoing observe tions by Dr Chambers and Professor Nicol. Clyne.—Remarkable aims apparently moraine lateral and terminal in Brora valley At Clynlish quarry the sandstone rocks striated in a direction from W. by N. to N.W. (First Report, pa 51). WIGTOWNSHIRE. Glasserton.—Granite boulder 9 x 6 x 6 feet weighing about 24 tons Longer axis N.E. and S'W. Two other boulders in a line with it. These supposed to have come from mountains to N.E., crossing an arm of the sea Several aims in the parish full of granite pebbles (F%rst Report, pa 38). of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84. 877 Glenluce.—The Rev. Mr Wilson reports the finding of water worn nodules of flings in beds of stratified drifts at different places along the coast for about 6 miles Various localities named where flints were found by Mr Wilson in daft beds up to 200 feet above sea He suggests that some of the drift materials probably came from Arran, and the flints from Armagh in Ireland (Ninth Report, pa 26). FArROE ISLANDS, Though these islands form no part of Scottish territory they are not so far from the Hebrides, Orkney, and Shetlands, as not to warrant some notice of their glacial phenomenal Moreover, having been visited by several Scotch geologists who reported on them to the Edinburgh Royal Society, it may be allowable to add a few notes bearing on the boulders and rock striations of these islands :— 1. Erratics. 1. The first traveller who noticed the glacial phenomena of the Faroes was the Rev. . Landt, a Danish clergyman whose book was translated into English in 1810, In page B of his treatise he says ¢ There are sometimes to be seen in the valleys single stones 6, 8, or 10 feet in diameter in places where it is impossible they could have fallen down from the hills Such stones are found also here and there at a considerable height on the hills where there is no other eminence in the neighbourhood from which they might have rolled down He adds a little farther on that these ¢ stones are generally round ” in shape 2. Dr James Geikie, in his elaborate and valuable Memoir on the Farce Islands, lately published in the Edinburgh Royal Society Transactions, vole xoxo pa 250, says under the head of Erratics, that large angular blocks of basalt rock are of common occurrence Near Thorshavn, many are of large size measuring occasionally upwards of 20 feet across They occupy positions which preclude the possibility of their having fallen or rolled down the hills ; and as they are now and again associated with moraine debris I do not doubt they have been deposited during the melting of the ice-sheet ” up 250). . . . “ While perched blocks are quite absent from the 878 Proceedings of the Royal Society hilltops which give no evidence of glaciation they are often scat tired abundantly over the surface of high ground which has been glacially abraded This is well seen upon the ridge between Groth and Skeelfiork, where isolated erratic are sprinkled about upon the moutonnée surface up 250). In the same paper Dr Geikie else where repeats that ¢ the large erratic scattered over hilltops and hillsides were doubtless deposited by the mer de glace during its final dissolution up 262). I1. Rock Strice. In the year 1812 Farde was visited by Sir George Mackenzie and Mr Allan, both Fellows of the Edinburgh Royal Society, and both of them well-versed in geological inquiries Both of them read to the Society accounts of their visit Sir George, in his paper expressed much satisfaction in having induced Mr Allan to be his companion on account of this great experience in geological examinations ” (Edz'm Roy. Soc. T'rans., vole vile pa 215). ' Mr Allan, in his paper refers more than once to a headland near the village of Eide, which the says presents a perpendicular front to the ocean So much interested was he in this “headland,” that he attempted to measure its height and found it to be 1134 feet page 242). In a subsequent passage he again alludes to this ‘“headland” as a thing of interested on account of the remarkable instance (it presented of the abrasion of its surface where the rock appears to have been worn down by the friction of heavy bodies up 244). Then remarking that generally in Farde, where the rocks do not consist of impracticable cliffs they present a solid smooth surface always highly inclined he goes on to say it would be curious to investigate whether this smoothness on the sides of the mountains could be traced to any external cause such as that which has been observed by Sir James Hall on Corstorphine Hill and other parts of the country indicating the passage of heavy bodies along the sure face Near Kide I observed a very remarkable example of this description There the rock was scooped and scratched in a very wonderful degrees not only on the horizontal surface but also on a vertical one of 30 to 40 feet high which had been opposed to the of Edinburgh, Session 188384, 879 current and presented the same scooping and polished appearance with the rest of the rock both above and below In the year 1855 the late Robert Chambers, also a Fellow of the Royal Society, who had previously paid much attention to glacial phenomenal visited the Fardes, and wrote an interesting account of what he saw He explains that being aware of Mr Allan’s dish cover at Eide, he went there on purpose to study the markings on the rocks The following is his description :~—* There are some small fields under cultivation FEvery here and there the rocks are presented on the surface where they are invariably seen rounded or flattened with peculiar deep channeling precisely like those rocks which are now generally believed te have been abraded by ice My attention being arrested by these features I looked narrowly for the strike or scratches which ice generally leaves on surfaces over which it has passed They presented themselves in abundance in several places most strikingly of all within earmark on the shore of the quiet bay being all directed from the north which i also the direction of the canal or channel ings and further of the passage or isthmus in which the village of Eide) lies In his Memoir on the Faroe Islands, Dr James Geikie up 246) referring to the same locality of Eide, says that ¢ perhaps the best preserved riches moutonnées we anywhere observed were in Osterve and Sandoe. It was with considerable interest that we visited the northern portion of the former island for we felt that the evidence to be gathered there would go a long way to settle the question which we had come to solve No difficulty was experienced in finding the locality described so long ago by Allan, and subset quietly visited by Chambers: but the tried instead of being directed from the morth,’ had clearly been grave by ice coming Jrom quite the opposite point of the compass The Kodlen peninsula we found emaciated all over the riches moutonnées on both sides of the isthmus being beautifully perfect and showing Sfogs and Lee- seinen in the most admirable manner In many places the stri are well seen and long suts.and channeling or grooves and trenches well smoothed and ice~worn, traverse the rock surface We faced the emaciated contour up to a height of 1302 feet which was fhe summit level of the pass leading from Eide to Funding; but the 880 Proceedings of the Royal Society slopes facing the sound between Osterde and Stromde seemed to be emaciated to a somewhat greater height The direction of glaciation upon those slopes so far as we could observe them seemed to be in a direction corresponding with the trend of the sounds namely from 8.8.E. to NNN.W.” As any facts bearing on the smoothed and striated rocks at Kide and the Kodlen peninsula deserve attention the following addie tonal paragraphs in Professor Geikie’s Memoir are quoted :— On page 254 he states that ¢ the soundings on the chart prove that the long ford which separates Stromde from Osterde occupies the bed of two submerged valleys with a low separating cold over which there is shallow water This col occurs in the narrow part of the sound between Nordskaale and Ore; and the soundings show that from this point the water deepens both towards N.W. and S.E. The ford is shallower at its mouth near Eide, where there are 5% and 9 fathoms of water than it is at and above Haldervig, where we get depths of 18 to 30, fathoms On page 261 Professor Geikie states that ¢ the long sound that separates Osterse from Stromde brimmed with ice which flowed in two directions North of Nordskaale the movement was northerly ; while south of the shallow part of that sound the ice held on a southerly course - A point apparently of some importance is brought out in Dr Geikie’s Memoir, viz that many of the hills show smoothing of rocks only up to a certain height Thus it is stated that ¢ the lower part of the mountains that over look Kolfaredel are smoothed and abraded in a S.E. direction and we estimated the height reached by the glacial outline to be some 1500 or 1600 feet Above that level all is rough and rugged and destitute of the slightest trace of glacial abrasions up 245). Then, on an adjoining mountain where there is a pass at 1243 feet above the sea there are * riches moutonnées,” but we saw no tried The emaciated outline was continued up the mountain slopes above us for not less than 400 feet up 245). In another locality * the cold we found to be 1693 feet above the sea and the glaciation came close up to this level But abraded rocks with the characteristic emaciated contour certainly reached 1600 feet up 246). of Edinburgh, Session 1883-84. 881 At pa 246 it is mentioned that the upper parts of the hills between Fundingsfiord and Andafiord were above the limits of glad ciation.” . . . “Suderde has supported a considerable mass of ice for we traced the emaciated outline up to a height of 1040 feet Above that level all is rough angular and serrated ” up 248). The explanation suggested by Dr Geikie of these interesting facts is that when the islands were enveloped in their ice-sheet, the action of frost would be confined to such ridges and hill tops as pro ejected above the mer de glace while severe glacial abrasion would go on below ” up 260). | Dr Geikie, in his Memoir, more than once takes notice of the scarcity of moraine mounds which he says it i difficult to account for satisfactorily ;”—but he offers under that head several suggestions ¢ the principal ” being “ probably the continuous and comparatively rapid dissolution of the ice after the snow-line had retreated several hundred feet above the sea-level ” up 263).
