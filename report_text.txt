  1. On the east side of Lochlang, opposite to Ardentinny, there ie the farm of Peaton. eteepigh hill which feces the north A gneiss boulder lice io = gorge out by the barn through rocks of clay slate On this farm & burn descends from a The boulder     resta on the rocky sides of the burn jammed in between the sides The boulder has some local name like * Jenny Meallen,” meaning % House on a knoll The height of the boulder above the ges is about 226 feet Its distance from the sea-beach is about three quarters of & miles The size of the boulder is about 24 x 18 x 12 feet It is most probable that the boulder was transported across the lech from the north or northwest and was arrested in its further progress southward by the hill on the north side of which it stands Two sketches of this boulder are given on Plate II. figs 1 and 2. 2. Between the site of this boulder and the gen-beach an old sea margin occurs at a height of about 45 feet above the sea medium level A number of boulders lie along the line of this sea margin There is en old sea margin on the opposite or west side of the loch at exactly the same height—rviz., 45 feat 3. Close to the beach in this part of Lochlong—i.e., about 8 or 9 feet above high-water market a place called “ Letter,” there liss another gneiss boulder 12 x 8 x 8 feet Its long diameter points N.W, by N.—viz, to Glenfinnart Valley, 4. Very near this boulder about 100 yards to the north the clay slate rocks have been ground down and smoothed Their smoothed surfaces show numerous series pointing N., 2° or 8° W, {magnetic). The smooth surface dips towards the north at an angle of 3° or 4°. 5. On the hill above Carrick Castle, situated on Lochgoil, there is a boulder called ““Clach udelain,” or the “Stone nicely balanced It is st & height of 1528 feet above the sea This boulder is of gneiss and lies on rocks of clay slate It lies on & bare rock the face of which slopes to N.N.E.—i.c, towards Lochgoil. The boulder is within three or four yards of the edge of & precipitous rocky cliff which goes vertically down about 500 or 600 feet The block ie of enormous size Unfortunately the note taken of its dimensions has been lost This boulder from its position could not have fallen from any hill There is no hill near it from which it could have failed A sketch of this boulder is given on Plate 1L fig 3. 6, The next boulder visited is about two miles to the eastward of the last-mentioned, and is within a quarter of & mile of Lochgoil, neer its junction with Lochiong. It is about 450 feet above the sea Ii may be observed that all the rocks in this district have their smooth faces towards the north their rough faces towards the south This boulder has received the name of the *Giant's Put- ting-Stone,” from & legend which alleges that in former times there were giants who inhabited the district on both sides of Loch- long and who were in the practice of amusing themselves by throw ing these huge boulders scroll the loch Therock on which it rests slopes gently N. by E. This rock presents a large surface ground down and smoothed The space of rock occupied by the superimposed boulder is only 18 inches by 12 inches It would not be difficult for two men with strong levers to move the boulder from its narrow resting-place, in which case the boulder would probably roll down the steep hillside into the loch Two sketches of this boulder are given on Plate ITI. figs 4 and 5. 7. To the north of Enap Farm-houss, thers is a small hill on or very near the top of which eight or ten boulders are clustered They suggest the idea that this hill has arrested or interrupted the body whatever that body was which transported the boulders and caused them to be stranded here 8. There is another hill lower down the valley of Knap about 4B0 feet above the sea the top of which consists of olay late rocket rounded and smoothed by some agent passing over from tha worth It has received the popular name of the “ Pig's Back.” Several boulders lie on this ridge The largest rest on a very small portion of rock A sketch of this ridge of rock with boulders on it, is given on Plate TII. fig 6. 9. Pulag boulder ia near the top of & hill to the west of Glen- finnart about 824 feet above the sea it is a large block of gneiss about 7 feet high There are many other smaller boulders lying near it, The large boulder is almost on the edge of a precipice which goes down at least 200 feet It couid not have been rolled or pushed to its present position The level of the district show tha greatest openings towards the north circumstance which suggests that the boulder came from the north Moreover, its south end rests on & smaller boulder which seems to have stopped its progress further south A sketch of this boulder is given on Plate ILL. fig 7. 10. Along various parts of the hills in this district where their highest range are seen against the sky and at i height of about 2000 feet above the sea boulders are discernible from a distance lying on the ridges It would be very desirable to obtain particular accounts of boulders at so high an elevation 11. In the last Report of the Committee, notice wae taken of & boulder in Ayrshirs called the * Hunterston Boulder.” Along the same cost sud especially on the property of Mr Alexander of Boydstone, several very large boulders may yet be seen One, called the '* Boydstone Rock or Stone,” is situated about two miles northwest of Ardrossan. Some chips of the boulder sent o the Convener in a letter show that it is porphyritic. The rocks on this part of the coast are Old Red Sandstone. The boulder is in Iength about 19 feet and in breadth about the sawed It is partly buried io the mud of the choral Tta highest point is 9} feet above the shore It is said to contain 40 cubic yards above the shore line It is supposed that the boulder is buried to the depth of 5 feet The tide at high water leaves about 3 feet of the boulder visible This boulder haa inspired the poetic genius of an Ayrshire letter-carrier (Malcolm Kerr, post-messenger between Ardrossan and West Kilbride), who through Mr Weir of Kirkhall, has sent to the Convener the following stirring address :— To the Great Boulder on the shore opposite to the lands of Boydstone, two miles north of Ardrossan, Ayrshire, ** Can'st thou speak old grey stone Unto me ? List then to the oceans moans T to thee Music sweet | Spirits string Wild ditties as they cling To tha big waves which swing Aroand thee Stranger | whence didst then come Ta this shore 1 Art thou an Arciic crumbs Which of yore On some hugs iceberg side From thy first home did glide A wandered on the tide To this shore ! Many eyes with wonder Ages gone Looked on thee ! What number Yet unknown Will gare with curious eye, - Beuking to know thy history And solve & hidden mystery Old grey stona,” Beaides the boulder which inspired these verses there are two others also on Mr Alexander's property—one of them as Mr Weir states “ even larger than the big stone at Brigurd, at Hunter- stone This larger one it was proposed to split up for building purpose at Ardrossan; but Mr Alexander interfered and saved it. There are many other boulders along the Ayrshire seacoast but none to large as the Boydstone boulder A chip of one of these santa shows that it is of gneiss indicating & northern origin 12. A report has been received of i gneiss boulder near Dun- blane on the property of Cromlix, belonging to the Hon. Captain Drummond, The length of the boulder is stated to be 173 fest it breadth on an average 10, its height about 5 feet Its longer axis lies in a direction southwest and northeast At its south end it dips into the ground at an angle of 45°. Its weight above ground is estimated at 84 tons Its eight above the sea ia about 450 feet It is about four miles south from the Grampians. The same reporter (Henry Wilkie, Ashfield Works, Dunblane) refers to & group of four boulders in the parish of Redgorton, at the west end of a gravel ridge on the farm of Bertha, the property of Murray Grabam, Beq, of Murrayehall. Three of these Redgorton boulders are within an area of 30 yards They are angular flat on the top aod some of them square They seem to be Silurian rocks They are distant about twelve miles from the Grampians. 18. Notice bas been received by the Convener from Mr Robert- son C.E,, who is in charge of the Albert New Docks at Leith, that boulder olay wae found in excavating for the docks beneath the shore line to the depth of about 70 feet The clay was full of large blocks Bome of these were of sandstone weighing 10 or 12 tons and appeared to be of the same rock e that worked st Granton and Craigleith Quarries to the westward Beneath the boulder clay there was found what the engineers call & running sand *' lying over strata of shale and sandstone Before concluding the Committee may advert to the circumstance that a part of the district comprehended in this Report was many years ago described by an eminent Scotch geologist—the late Charles M‘Laren—and with reference to the very matters embraced in this report Mr M‘Laren read papers in this Society, in the years 1846—47, describing the boulders then existing.on the shores of the Gairloch, and on the hills between that loch and Lachlong. Even then the destruction of boulders in that quarter had begun being appropriated as Mr M'Laren states o building purposes and probably by this fime they have all been annihilated Mr M‘Laren in these papers described also the striation and smoothing of the rocks which he found from the ses-ghore up to the tops of the ridges between the Gairloch and Lochlong, at heights of about 1000 feet above the ses Itis due alike to the memory of our Associate, and {0 the interests of geological science to mention that the boulders referred to by him as found on the @airloch, consisted of grey granite of which is counted above & hundred one-third of them exceeding 30 fons in weight a also miss gate which though lees numerous had had among them blocks of 60 and 80 tons in weight As the rocks of the Gairloch in ifwe are of a more recent kind—viz. clay slate—Mr M‘Laren justly inferred that the boulders were of northern origin For those of granite he pointed to Ben Cruachan, a mountain exceeding 3000 feet's height situated to the N.N.W., and distant about thirty miles The mica late hill are also in the some direction somewhat more distant from his study of the boulders and other phenomena in this district Mr M‘Laren drew two important conclusions One conclusion west that the boulders must bave been brought to the district from the parent mount trains across valleys and ranges of hills on ice floating on = sea which stood from 1500 to 2000 feet above the present sea-level, and in which a strong current had prevailed from the N.W. This con clusion, it will be noticed is confirmed by the facts specified in the YOL. IX. a present Report, and algo in former Reports by the Commitice. The numerous instances given in these Reports of huge boulders shown by their composition to be of northern rocks clustered frequently on the summits or perks of hills at heights of 1500 and 2000 feet above the present mea-fevel, seem to leave no doubt regarding the soundness of that conclusion to which Mr M‘Laren had come to thirty years ago The other conclusion to which Mr M‘Laren came sud which many good geologists of the present day hold was thia thet local glaciers had st one time existed in all those valleys Thia he inferred from observing that the striations on the rocks were all as he thought exactly parallel with the axis of the valley and which here generally runs in & direction northwest and southeast ; and also from discovering accumulations of gravel and clay in the form of elongated embankments—some across the valleys others parallel with the valleys reminding him of the lateral and terminal moraine of Switzerland. As to the soundness of this second conclusion or the correctness of the observations an which it was founded the Committee give no opinion None of the members of the Committes have visited the Jocalities, and their function se & Committee hes beer chiefly to collect facts connected with the boulders But it my not be out of place to record the fact that another of our Associates, the late Bobert Chambers, who had also given much attention to this branch of geological science went to examine the districts referred to by Mr M‘'Laren, and expressed doubts regarding these last mentioned views In two papers read by him in this Society in December 1852, Chambers states that on the rocky ridge between Lochlong and Holy Loch, at a height of 600 feet above the sea the direction of the striations was not parallel with the valley but “ planting over the hill ; ¥ and as the striations were not merely the sides of the valleys but on the tops of the hilly ranges dividing the valleys he thought they were more probably due to & general glaciation of the country than to local glaciers Chambers quotes also the opinion of Sir Roderick Murchison, * that there is no imaginable centre for the issue of glaciers of the ordinary kind down the Gairloch.” On this point the Committee offer no opinion and wish only to advert to the investigations of eminent Sootoh geology   girls who in former days attempted a solution of these difficult quest tions The Committee would ventura to suggest a reexamination of the localities a the fuller knowledge now possessed on these subjects may possibly throw a clearer light on the phenomenon The Committee wish only to add that if any geologists whether fellows of this Society or not happen in the course of their rambles through the country to fall in with or hear of any boulders red remarkable for size position or composition not yet mentioned in the Committea’s Reports, the Convener will be happy to receive i notice of them After some conversation in which Mr Ferguson of Kinmundy, Dr Bryce, the Rev, T. Brown, and others tock part the Report was adopted and the proceedings terminated
